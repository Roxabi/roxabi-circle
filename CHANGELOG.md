# Changelog

## Unreleased

### API-only stack contract

- An API-only Product replaces the whole `.dev/stack.yml` `frontend` block with the canonical null scalar `frontend: null` and keeps that scalar on upgrade. No frontend App is required. The guard compares values, not filesystem existence; `~`, implicit empty, `Null`, a quoted string, a missing key, and a partial map still fail (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#591).

### Independent public root preparation

- Permit an ordinary local first commit to reach both staged secret-scan passes before `HEAD` exists; explicit ranges, commit-only scans and Git errors still fail closed (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#510).
- Document the exact-tree archive into an independent root, normal hooks, private provenance and fresh-clone validation. Local proof is not hosted configuration or public exposure.
- Admit a no-baseline snapshot's marked migration only when its raw bytes match the same path in an actual parentless commit reachable from `HEAD`; shallow history, grafts and replacements cannot supply that evidence. Marker syntax and established-baseline checks remain strict. This admission does not attest a historical deployment (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#591).
- Exercise the candidate's root gate before the reader clone creates `origin/main`, so local preparation covers the first-push context rather than only transport-clone validation.
- Distinguish private and already-public Products: a public consumer may publish a transition only after the Kit exposure checkpoint, without introducing private-only Kit ancestry.
- Carry the Kit's MIT notice with all inherited Kit material in the protected `docs/kit/licenses/MIT.txt`, a byte-identical copy of the root `LICENSE`, and remove the root `package.json` license field so no protected root file declares a Product's terms. A Product's root `LICENSE` stays Product-owned and unprotected: the independent-history join and every later upgrade merge restore its pre-merge presence and bytes before committing, even when they match the Kit's notice, and a change of Product terms is the Product's own reviewed commit. The Kit notices state only the Kit's terms.

### Inactive CI App workflows

- Restore successful manual operation when the CI App and authorization policy are absent: skip evaluation, token minting and automated receipt writes. With a complete valid policy but no App, retain read-only evaluation for manual merging.
- Default-ref automation rejects partial or malformed supplied policy, including when the App is disabled. Active setup errors remain failures, and active exact-head receipt checks and token scopes are unchanged.
- Return before loading the adapter on unprivileged `pull_request` events so consumers can inherit from a default branch that predates it; no new adapter export or fallback is required.

### Zod Worker entry initialization

- Correct Zod 4.6.7 metadata only: set `sideEffects` to `true` in the nested `v4/package.json` and `v4/classic/package.json` to preserve initialization across static `zod/v4` and dynamic root imports (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#585). The compiler itself is not fixed.
- Bundlers may retain more code and initialize it eagerly. The patch lives under `config/kit/patches/`, already protected by the `config/kit/` zero-edit prefix.
- Remove the patch only when an unpatched newer upstream release passes the entry regression and the real unified product Worker passes under workerd. The regression alone does not prove UI, OAuth or workerd behavior.

### Task link cycles

- Reject any same-kind cycle an incomplete walk used to allow, including a short cycle behind a wide fan-out and a cycle closed through a long chain. Still accept a wide acyclic graph entered at its root, including a shared descendant, and a new link whose walk meets an existing cycle without returning to its source. Organization, kind, reflexive, duplicate and single-parent checks are unchanged (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#583).
- **Breaking:** remove unused `MAX_LINK_TRAVERSAL` from `@kit/tasks`. Link issue codes and request payloads are unchanged. No Kit or Example App reference required a migration.

### Better Auth logging

- Route the Kit factory's Better Auth logger to fixed severity events without forwarding library-controlled messages or arguments, which can include credentials in database errors. Keep the default warning threshold (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#578).
- Prevent Better Call's independent raw-error fallback by converting non-API handler exceptions to a fixed event and empty 500, including exceptions before the router that previously propagated. Returned 5xx responses get a fixed event; diagnostic causes are intentionally lost.
- This covers the factory logger and HTTP handler, not direct API callers, other App or library logs, HTTP bodies or Cloudflare serialization. Product inheritance and deployment are not established by this change.

### Verification credential security

- Hash Better Auth verification identifiers globally and share the hash with Kit-minted welcome/reset tokens; leave magic-link `storeToken` unset to avoid double hashing. Resetting a password revokes all sessions, and origin checks are now enabled in tests (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#395).
- Retain magic-link GET with an accepted login-CSRF residual and revisit triggers; see [ADR-0002 D8](docs/kit/architecture/adr/0002-session-hmac-interim-vs-better-auth.md#d8--verification-credentials-and-magic-link-get).
- No schema migration or deletion: Better Auth 1.7.14 can fall back to current-format plain identifiers until expiry. Older 1.7.6 bare-token magic links are rejected by 1.7.14, independently of this hash change; request a new link. Targeted behavioral tests passed; this does not prove deployment or the full CI gate.

### Auth address buckets

- Normalize IPv6 addresses to a shared /64 rate-limit bucket, including invitation acceptance; retain IPv4 address buckets and map IPv4-mapped IPv6 to the same IPv4 key (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#360).

### Hosted OAuth grant admission

- Add optional, deny-only `grantAdmission` to `@kit/mcp/hosted`, using a provider-verified OAuth grant tuple before tools run and before code or refresh exchanges issue tokens.
- Refuse explicit denials; distinguish unavailable predicates with fail-closed 503 responses that preserve the authorization for a later valid retry instead of revoking it.
- Preserve omitted-option behavior, existing OAuth controls and Product-owned policy storage. The narrowly approved ADR-0015 exception does not claim a second Product consumer or relax future promotion rules.

### Hosted MCP consent presentation

- Add optional static `consentPresentation` to `@kit/mcp/hosted`: Kit-owned English/French security labels and escaped, App-owned service/disclosure text on the existing consent form.
- Capture presentation at Worker construction; preserve default English behavior and all consent, CSRF, identity, scope, PKCE and token-lifetime controls. The option grants no renderer or authorization capability.

### Public preparation

- Consolidate current ADRs and Product onboarding, retiring obsolete proposals and internal journals while preserving the Kit contracts (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#508, Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#509).
- License Kit-owned contributions under MIT, copyright UnkillableCompanies; retain scoped third-party notices for shadcn UI, the dependency license checker and generated Worker declarations, and keep npm publication disabled (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#507).
- Clarify that App notification service and Task/Flow producer composition exist; User/email Delivery runtime is implemented while live proof remains outstanding.
- Prepare the approved independent public-first identity `go-silex/unkillable-kit`, protecting its contribution/security policies and retaining legacy identities only for the transition. Product push-denial also recognizes the new parent.
- Add public-safe contribution and issue-reporting guidance, collaborator-only PR policy and private vulnerability disclosure at `team@unkillablecompanies.com`; distinguish written policy from effective GitHub settings and post-publication scanning.
- Document the one-time independent-history consumer transition and subsequent ordinary upgrade, preserving Product content and applied schema identities. Refresh the inheritance marker in the ordinary upgrade recipe.
- Permit an explicitly approved shared merge-App installation as an owner exception, retaining cross-repository key exposure and all exact-head admission checks. No live credentials, merge automation, consumer migration or public target are provisioned by these source changes.

### Reviewed-head authorization

- Implement local exact repository/PR/head grant and withdrawal receipts with authenticated issuer identities, predecessor and edit proof, and require the same selected receipt at evaluation and final SHA-pinned merge. Labels are wakeup hints, not authority. The existing native and manual admission owners remain responsible for review and budget; automatic Dependabot admission binds its evaluated base as well as head (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#506).
- Align environment, workflow ownership and post-cutover guidance with explicit exact-head receipt admission rather than label authority.
- The local adapter fails closed on incomplete or invalid authorization evidence. A read-only production plugin CLI smoke against the source repository refused the missing repository authorization policy; it made no writes. This is not evidence of a live deployment, provisioned target, successful merge or a completed full gate.
- Retain default-ref dispatch and trusted workflow boundaries; older workflow definitions, trusted history edits or deletion, and the non-atomic final read/merge remain residual risks.

### Impersonation

- Add session-bound, Organization-scoped Impersonation with separate default-off read/write permissions per internal Platform Role, configured by `super_admin`.
- Preserve the real Better Auth operator session and audit attribution while applying the represented User's rights. Refuse privileged targets, cross-Organization access, credential/security changes, durable operations and personal data outside the Organization.
- Add permission controls and start actions to the user directory, a persistent return banner, cross-tab synchronization and request-context fencing. Consent, target notifications, custom duration limits and additional reauthentication are not included.
- Commit start/configuration audit atomically and persist business-request attempts before dispatch; stop remains independent of audit availability.
- Keep recovery and explicit return available when introspection is cancelled; reverted query-cache data cannot confirm an identity transition.
- **Breaking:** session payloads now include the verified `sessionId`; `/api/me` includes required `impersonation` and `impersonationPermissions` fields. Sync the additive core migration `0024_impersonation.sql`; see the [consumer contract](docs/kit/product-consumer-contract.md).

### Flow approval lifecycle ports

- Add optional approval-opened and approval-closed ports to `driveFlowRun`, with stable Organization/run/task identity and the winning D1 approval outcome (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#474).
- Run callbacks in dedicated caller-owned Workflow steps with three native retries. Scrub callback failures before owner logging; after exhaustion, log and continue without changing the business decision, deadline or wake budget. Notification loss remains possible; forced termination does not guarantee closure. Producer composition and live lifecycle guards remain App-owned, as described below.

### Notifications

- Add the pure `@kit/notifications` root: validated immutable type registration, User and Organization destination resolution, delivery eligibility, JSON display-parameter validation and an App-copy email layout (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#476).
- Keep `tasks.assigned` and `flows.approval_requested` declarations in the Example App, with email and Slack enabled by default under external rules. Their pure definitions do not dispatch providers or own durable Delivery execution.
- Resolve rules from one captured set of Channel, selector and boolean values per call, and validate and match each Organization destination against one captured selector, so accessor-backed inputs cannot change policy between validation and delivery eligibility.
- Add separate `@kit/notifications/schema` and `/repos` exports, seven constrained tables, the opt-in `notifications` catalog set and additive Example App migration `0023` (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#477).
- Admit Inbox rows and initial Delivery intentions atomically, preserve active-source deduplication, scope Inbox and configuration operations by their exact owner, and commit administration audit with effective mutations.
- Persist monotone admission observations with a fixed 24-hour deadline, conditional terminal receipts, unified fair candidate pagination and bounded Organization-scoped retention. The App derives Workflow identities and never reuses Delivery IDs; storage does not create or restart a Workflow.
- Preserve every decoded cursor key in the shared core helper, including JSON `__proto__` data keys, so Notifications' strict keyset schemas can reject unknown input instead of silently losing it before validation.
- Add the session-only Example App Notifications HTTP interface: global User rules, type catalogue, Organization-scoped Inbox and effective rules, and Deployment/Organization administration metadata (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#478).
- Gate Organization administration with `manage_notifications` at `admin`, preserve logged support reads without an Inbox or write bypass, and commit admin rule audit atomically. Personal rules and read marks remain unaudited; authenticated API keys are refused.
- Render Inbox content from API-owned French/English catalogues at read time, expose configured lock provenance separately from live Module availability, and validate strict request/keyset shapes without widening the 512-character cursor cap. This HTTP slice adds no destination route or Delivery runtime; producer composition is described below.
- Preserve JSON media-type client faults as safe 400 responses, retain schema field errors, and project the complete external-Channel/ASCII identifier grammar and closed Delivery DTO into OpenAPI.
- Route approval Notification links through the authenticated App run view for eligible Organization members without a Platform role; keep the administrative entry restricted and the flows API authoritative.

### Notification producers

- Add server-only App `notify` / `resolve` composition with factual Organization, membership and Module access, complete rule/destination pagination, optional actor exclusion, and independent collective intentions without a collective Inbox (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#479).
- Connect Task assignment events through the existing awaited audit hook, filter each recipient through object visibility, and resolve removal, deletion, completion or a terminal stage. The Task adapter gates resolution and pending Delivery skips on current lifecycle facts inside one D1 batch; a delayed removal or compensation cannot close a later eligible reassignment. Reopening alone emits nothing.
- Connect Flow approval ports to the existing owner. Every opening checks current D1 run, sealed approve task, waiting receipt and terminal decision before and after admission. Decision and cancellation routes attempt exact-source resolution after committed business writes and before wake or termination, including repair on repeats; resolution failure never reverses the business decision.
- Add optional trusted, repository-only SQL predicates that narrow the existing resolution scope and both lifecycle pairs atomically. Task domain stays in the App; the pure root, generic `ResolveInput`, unconditional default resolution and read timestamps remain unchanged.
- Persist stable SHA-256 Delivery identities and their original 24-hour admission deadlines, but do not create a Delivery Workflow, contact providers or reconcile admission. E5 owns those effects; E4-era pending intentions are not an eventual-send guarantee and may never be sent automatically after their original admission window closes.

### Notification email Delivery

- Compose User/email intentions with a separate, stable-ID `NotificationDeliveryWorkflow` after the Inbox transaction commits; admission failures preserve the committed result and do not prevent sibling handoffs (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#480).
- Keep automatic admission inside the original 24-hour window, observe existing owners without restarting them, and reconcile one fair page per Organization. Slack and Organization/email remain uncomposed: they are not sent or falsely finalized because a channel is unavailable.
- Use three native steps, five send retries and a strict private retry envelope with an explicitly constant backoff. Every physical attempt rechecks current access, rules, resolution and verified email; terminal receipts and checkpointed sends are not replayed. Acceptance before checkpoint can still produce a duplicate.
- Render localized App copy, trusted source links and the authenticated rules API link in both email formats; preserve staging policy and classify only typed local or documented structured CF errors. `sent` means transport acceptance, not recipient receipt.
- Add five-minute maintenance and bounded retention, terminalizing pending children before Notification cascade deletion. Preserve native retention defaults without claiming effective account retention or automatic expiry from local tests.



### Tasks and Organization integrity

- Add optional assignee deltas to task mutation events. Task creation and its initial assignees commit atomically; replacement and its baseline read also share one D1 batch, including rollback across insert chunks. Unchanged updates omit the event field and audit metadata excludes assignee ids (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#473).
- **Breaking:** `replaceAssignees` returns `{ added, removed }` or `null` for an unowned task, rather than a boolean. Migrate callers to the [consumer contract](docs/kit/product-consumer-contract.md).
- Promote the Tasks tenancy contract migration after deployed-expand, live-count and disposable-D1 proof. Add database stage-ownership guards without rebuilding tasks; Organization foreign-key rebuilds remain pending and refuse unknown inbound dependencies before touching data (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#348, Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#400).

### CI runtime

- Keep local Root complete, ordered and fail-fast, joining current-run Core and Coverage receipts into the CI verdict. The deploy check conservatively proves the CI `always()` conjunction on push while refusing unknown conditions (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#555).
- Amortize Coverage setup across bounded Package groups with a single-pass partition while keeping Apps dedicated, preserving an independent Root invocation and receipt per workspace, and collecting every workspace's report tree before the next cleanup.
- Preserve valid push-safe consumer conditions with separately parenthesized boolean operands in the deploy-gate check.
- Reuse real credential hashes only in synthetic API fixtures; keep default seeds and authentication operations on real crypto, with independent-salt and cross-context reset oracles.
- Keep the Web QueryClient registry separate from the provider renderer so global test setup does not preload the rendering graph; exercise query-cache isolation after a failing teardown.
- Inventory TypeScript inputs without repeating semantic type checking; run Biome global-rule plants with a snapshot of the root config and ignore file through the installed, lockfile-pinned package, retaining the actual-root config contract and full-root lint. Reject ambient binary overrides instead of testing a different executable from lint.
- Use all available CPUs in the five measured multi-file Kit suites only in CI, preserving local run/watch defaults, per-file isolation and sequential coverage execution.
- Default Auth tests to Node and opt the real forms renderer into happy-dom per file; retain explicit renderer cleanup and the existing isolation and coverage floors.

### Dependency maintenance

- Update shared dependencies while temporarily holding Biome at 2.5.15, the already pinned patch; align its configuration schema metadata. Kit maintainers own the hold and its removal (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#549). Biome features, fixes and security fixes available only in 2.6 or later are deferred; security alerts still require review. Remove the hold only after real-document GFM semantic preservation and repeated-format idempotence fixtures pass and the applicable formatting, documentation and full gates pass.
- Raise the shared Zod minimum to 4.6.7, matching the already resolved version.
- Update Happy DOM test environments to 21.0.4 or later to address GHSA-834v-8h66-3h79.

### Documentation gates

- The ADR index gate accepts alignment padding in table cells while retaining reference and status checks.

### Markdown

- The Example App uses `@tanstack/markdown` 1.x. Its `SafeMarkdown` wrapper retains disabled HTML, dropped images and protected outbound links; consumers should verify their own Markdown rendering when upgrading.

### MCP tool refusals

- `toolRefusal(payload)` opts a tool into a domain refusal with MCP `isError: true`, structured content and JSON text. Ordinary results remain successes; unexpected exceptions retain public-error redaction.
- FastMCP's minimum compatible version is `^4.23.8`; the hosted Edge upgrade forwards refusal flags. Register tools through the existing catalogue seam.
- On hosted Edge, thrown tool errors now arrive as MCP results with `isError: true`, rather than JSON-RPC errors. Unsupported `MCP-Protocol-Version` headers on non-initialize requests now receive HTTP 400; initialize negotiates a supported requested protocol version.

### Dependabot automation

- Evaluate Dependabot changes from captured immutable head and base evidence; a withheld, failed or mismatched result cannot publish an automatic authorization receipt.

### Authentication reads

- Better Auth uses native Drizzle joins for session/user and related account/Organization reads. Supplied schema tables receive matching relation metadata; no SQL migration or cookie-format change is needed.
- **Breaking:** `createOrgMiddleware` replaces the `findOrgById` and `findMembership` ports with `findOrgContext(db, orgId, subject)`. Migrate both properties together; keep `getPlatformRole` for the standalone Platform Role guard. See the [consumer migration](docs/kit/product-consumer-contract.md#authentication-reads-and-organization-context-migration).
- Organization context reads status, the subject's Organization membership and Platform Role in one scoped query. Ordinary nonmembers receive 404 regardless of Organization status; suspended members remain forbidden. Super-admin break-glass, bypass audit and Module checks are preserved, without cross-request authorization caching.
- The permanent authentication regression contract for Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#532 is described in [testing](docs/kit/testing.md#authentication-regressions). This is not a production latency claim or a resolution of Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#398.
