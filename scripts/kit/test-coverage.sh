# Run Vitest coverage for all kit packages/apps with thresholds.
# HTML + json-summary → coverage/<name>/
#
# The set of workspaces is DISCOVERED from the root package.json `workspaces`
# globs: every workspace declaring a `test:coverage` script is part of the bar.
# The order tables only fix the RUN ORDER (risk tiers) — they are never the
# source of truth for membership. Any divergence between the discovered set and
# the declared tiers is a hard failure, so no package can silently enter or
# leave the bar without an explicit, reviewed declaration of its risk tier.
#
# Two declaration sites, same rules:
#   - kit tiers: the COVERAGE_* arrays below (kit workspaces only).
#   - product tiers: config/product/coverage-order.txt, one `<tier> <workspace>`
#     per line (`#` comments), tier = high | medium | lower. The file is read
#     in every mode (product repo or kit-mode clone alike, no inheritance marker
#     needed) and lives in the product namespace, so adding a workspace never
#     edits this kit file. Run order = kit high, product high, kit medium,
#     product medium, kit lower, product lower.
# A discovered workspace in neither place, a stale entry, a duplicate (also
# across the two sites), an unknown tier or a malformed line all fail. There is
# deliberately no auto-append: an undeclared workspace never lands in a tier by
# default.
#
# COVERAGE_LIST_ONLY=1 prints the resolved order and exits 0 without running
# Vitest or touching coverage/ (verification seam).
#
# COVERAGE_LIST_KIT=1 prints the kit tiers alone (COVERAGE_HIGH, COVERAGE_MEDIUM,
# COVERAGE_LOWER in that order, one per line) and exits 0 before the extension
# file is read or any workspace is discovered: product entries never appear and
# nothing is reconciled. The coverage-order self-test builds its fixtures from
# it (verification seam).
#
# COVERAGE_ONLY=<workspace> keeps a single already-resolved workspace. The Root
# gate sets it only through --ci-coverage-shard. It cannot execute the full gate.
#
# COVERAGE_CHANGED_BASE=<git-ref> narrows the printed or local run to changed
# apps when every changed path is under apps/<name>/. A package path, a root
# path, an empty diff or an unreadable ref keeps or refuses the full bar; it
# never drops the bar silently. This mode cannot execute the Root gate.
