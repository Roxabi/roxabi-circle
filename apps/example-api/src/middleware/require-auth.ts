/**
 * Org-bound keys only: re-check membership + active org on every use (ADR-0003 D11).
 *
 * A row without `organization_id` is denied outright rather than skipping the re-check.
 * ADR-0003 D11 forbids subject-global keys, so such a row has no valid interpretation:
 * previously it authenticated while bypassing the membership + active-org checks entirely,
 * which meant a key minted before org-binding kept working forever even after its subject
 * was removed from every org.
 *
 * These rows can only be pre-`0008` legacy data: migration `0008_api_keys_organization.sql`
 * added the column nullable and told operators to re-mint but never revoked, and `mintApiKey`
 * now refuses a missing organization unconditionally (`services/auth.ts`).
 *
 * Authority for this rule is **ADR-0003 D11**, not a marker here.
 *
 * Marker asymmetry below is deliberate and measured, not an oversight. This function is
 * module-private: do not export it only to satisfy a documentation or analysis tool. Markers
 * that arm block-tier rules on private helpers are omitted for that reason (invariant and
 * security). The capability marker arms nothing — no rule reads it — so it stays for navigation.
 *
 * Names of the omitted markers are written without their leading sigil on purpose: `parseMarkers`
 * runs over the JSDoc attached to a TypeScript symbol, so naming them literally here would declare
 * the very markers this comment says are absent. (That hazard is specific to `.ts` doc comments —
 * Markdown cannot produce a marker.)
 *
 * Precedent for the rule: the `grant.ts` marker that asserted "unknown keys are rejected" while a
 * test in the same commit disproved it. Repo policy — annotate only what a gate can target;
 * otherwise the rule lives in the ADR.
 *
 * @capability auth-api-key-lookup
 *
 * The behaviour is covered by integration: `org-rbac.test.ts` mints a real org-bound key, proves
 * it authenticates, strips only `organization_id`, and requires 401.
