# Testing strategy — Chemin A kit

SSoT for **how we test** this monorepo. Complements the [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) constitution, [documentation index](./README.md), [development process](./processes/dev-process.md), [stack standard](./standards/stack.md), axial [ADR-0001](architecture/adr/0001-primary-axis-packages-compose-apps.md) and dual-credential [ADR-0002](architecture/adr/0002-session-hmac-interim-vs-better-auth.md).

## Doctrine (one screen)

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Effective tests > vanity %** | Ask: *if this breaks in prod, which test fails?* |
| **Local is the real gate** | Full validate + coverage **before push**. CI is a **guardrail** (catch skip hooks / broken machine), not the place you discover red. |
| **Tiered floors, not one goal** | High floors on auth/API; low global floors on ui/web **only if** named contracts stay green. |
| **Ownership follows PRIMARY axis** | Package contracts in `packages/*`; composition in `apps/example-*`; product risks only in `apps/<product>-*`, in product repositories. |
| **No checklist theater** | PR boxes map to **named suites / CP-IDs**, not “tests added”. |
| **Optional tooling has a phase** | Playwright / mutation: phased or explicitly out of merge — no limbo. |

**Anti-slogan:** “We deprioritized coverage for quality” must never mean “we lowered T0 floors” or “we deleted negative cases.”

## Ops model — local first, CI guardrail

CI minutes and red loops on GitHub are costly (Free private, agents, merge-on-green). **Policy:**

```text
Developer / agent workstation
  pre-commit  → Biome (staged)           # fast
  pre-push    → bun run validate:full    # full local SoT
         ↓
  push only when green locally
         ↓
GitHub CI     → same gates again         # guardrail only
         ↓
merge-on-green (current exact-head authorization receipt + checks)
```

| Layer | Role | Cost expectation |
|---|---|---|
| **Lefthook pre-push** | **Primary kit bar** — `validate:full` | Accept wall-clock; fix here |
| **CI** (check `ci`, runs `validate:full`) | **Secondary kit bar** — same `validate:full` if hooks skipped or local env lied | Should almost always be green if pre-push ran |
| **Product CI** (`product-validate`) | **Product bar** — typecheck/test/build for `apps/<product>-*` via **copied** templates ([`product-validate.example.sh`](./templates/product-validate.example.sh), [`product-ci.example.yml`](./templates/product-ci.example.yml)) | Product repos only; not kit CI |
| **Secret scan** | Orthogonal security | Always — **two passes, see below** |

### CI runtime budget

The quality jobs and final `ci` join each request a five-minute execution timeout. The root `package.json` remains the gate's source of truth; meeting the budget must not remove controls, lower coverage floors or weaken test isolation.

The measured quality path includes every producer's queue, checkout, installation, all controls, report and receipt handling, and the final join and cleanup. Cancellation, `always()` steps and runner cleanup can outlive a timeout; use actual workflow and job timestamps and a complete success verdict to prove ≤300 seconds for the whole DAG. Per-job timeout settings are not that proof and do not change independent Product workflow timeouts.

Distinguish cold task/transform caches from warm runs, and record the runner, cache state and complete exit status. A cached tool download is not a cached task result. Local measurements are not evidence of GitHub runner performance; successful real CI evidence is required separately in the kit and a product consumer.

The measured multi-file Auth, Flows, UI, Example API and Example Web suites use all available CPUs only when the existing `CI` flag is non-empty. Without it, Vitest's run/watch worker defaults remain unchanged. Local Root executes the complete ordered recipe sequentially and fails fast. `COVERAGE_CHANGED_BASE` is a local seam and cannot execute the Root gate.

CI runs its ordered Core complement on one hosted VM. The read-only Root `--coverage-plan` mode partitions the complete discovered Coverage bar: every App has a dedicated job, while Packages are distributed round-robin into groups of at most four, preserving their relative order inside each group. Packages in a group share a VM and filesystem, but each workspace runs in a separate canonical Root process through the same `bunx vitest run --coverage` invocation, with unchanged per-file isolation and coverage floors. The coverage script itself stays sequential when it runs more than one workspace. No runner-level worker override changes Product configurations.

Each workspace produces its own receipt. Ordinary workspace failures do not prevent later members of the group from running; any failure keeps the group red. Before the next invocation clears `coverage/`, the entire available report tree is moved into a workspace-qualified directory, including after a failed invocation. Receipt and report artifacts remain separate.

The final `ci` check requires every producer to succeed and a substantive current-run receipt join, bound to the actual checkout, run, attempt, recipe and runner. A monolithic Coverage receipt remains accepted; a shard set must name every discovered workspace, independently of how many workspaces share a runner. Fewer configured jobs alone prove neither a shorter workflow nor a reduction in billed usage; both require real CI measurements.

Receipt binding detects accidental stale, foreign or incomplete execution, not malicious changes to trusted workflow code. The pinned official artifact downloader fails on a digest mismatch by default; digest validation does not replace the receipt join.

Auth tests default to Node; files requiring a browser DOM opt in with `/** @vitest-environment happy-dom */`. The real forms renderer uses that environment, with explicit React Testing Library cleanup before the shared mock, global, environment, timer and storage restorers. Server tests retain their real behavior and per-file isolation; the coverage floors and test membership are unchanged.

Vitest 5.0.5 enables persistent transformed-module caching by default. A cold proof must control the resolved project cache directories and observed project compiler build caches, such as TypeScript `.tsbuildinfo`, before the complete gate starts, not just Turbo's task cache. Warming generated by steps inside that same cold-started gate is part of its measured work; a previously populated project cache is a different condition. This does not imply cold OS, tool, package or global Node caches.

### Merge residual (GitHub Free private)

The maintained merge gate uses an authenticated receipt bound to the repository, PR and exact head, not a `reviewed` or `deps-automerge` label. Dependabot receipts also bind the evaluated base SHA. See [CI App setup](./ci-app-setup.md#reviewed-head-authorization) and [the guard](./security-dependabot.md#auto-merge-guard).

On GitHub Free private, `merge-on-green` is **process**, not branch protection: no required checks or reviewers are implied.

Anyone with **write** (or admin) can:

- merge a PR in the UI / `gh pr merge` without the receipt and without waiting for `ci` + TruffleHog;
- push directly to `main`.

When configured, the maintained workflow scans eligible open PRs on trusted wakeups; a label is only a hint. It requires an open, mergeable, non-draft PR and a valid current receipt. The whole authenticated stream is read before selecting its newest record; a malformed, edited, wrong-scope or duplicate-operation selected record holds. Numeric issuer identity, predecessor and GraphQL edit/association proof are checked. A later withdrawal denies all lanes; a fresh explicit admission is required to reissue.

**Kit** evidence remains deliberately neutral: every check run on the head other than `merge-on-green` is completed with conclusion `success`, `neutral` or `skipped`, at least one run exists, the combined commit status is `success` when present, and `ci` plus TruffleHog are among the runs. The separate **Product** rule resolves the live base, reads Product declarations at immutable base and head, and requires each declared workflow's latest matching head run and exact-attempt jobs to succeed, with a post-job run re-read. Missing or invalid head declarations and skipped Product evidence hold.

Evaluation queues the head and exact receipt; immediately before each SHA-pinned merge the gate repeats scope, checks and authorization and requires the same receipt. A replacement on the same SHA requires new evaluation. After each sequential merge it resolves the next base again. Gate reads use `GITHUB_TOKEN`; a separately scoped CI App token performs the merge.

A `409` merge response is a stale hold for that candidate and the sequential loop continues to other candidates; any other merge-write error enters the `unreadable` bucket and makes the run red, despite that bucket's name.

Behavioral tests do not establish GitHub event delivery, live configuration or checkout provenance. GitHub reads and merge are separate, so external authorization, base or check changes after the final observation remain residual; older or alternative workflow definitions may omit the maintained guards. Append-only is a publisher convention, not immutable GitHub storage: trusted deletion or editing away of history can erase a fence. Returning to identical A without an accepted withdrawal may match again, although A never authorizes B. Trusted operators, default-branch writers and dispatchers, administrators and App managers remain inside the trust boundary.

Do **not** claim “main is protected” or “label `reviewed` is required”. When the plan allows Team/rulesets: require `ci`, TruffleHog, and non-draft.

**Secret scan: why it runs TruffleHog twice (do not collapse it back)**

`--only-verified` keeps the generic detectors quiet by reporting only what TruffleHog could
confirm against the issuing provider's API. A `sk_` key **this kit mints itself** has no such
provider, so it is always an *unverified* finding — and that flag discards it **silently**.

Measured on trufflehog 3.96.0 (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#51 dual-pass — still true). Length-anchor fixtures
(3.97.0: `sk_<48hex>Z` hits, `sk_<49hex>` does not) live in
[`scripts/kit/trufflehog-detectors.yaml`](../../scripts/kit/trufflehog-detectors.yaml).

| Invocation | Result |
|---|---|
| `--only-verified` (generic pass) | `unverified_secrets: 0` → **exit 0, the key passes** |
| `--config=scripts/kit/trufflehog-detectors.yaml`, no such flag | `unverified_secrets: 1` → exit 183 |
| same config over the whole repo | `unverified_secrets: 0` → no false positives |

So: generic detectors keep `--only-verified`; kit-issued secrets get a **separate** pass
without it. Adding the detector while keeping the flag yields a green scan and zero coverage —
the failure mode is invisible, which is why this is written down rather than left to the diff.
Do **not** merge the two invocations, and do **not** add `--only-verified` to the custom pass.

Scope: both passes are **diff-scoped** (PR base…head; locally, commits after the origin base).
A secret force-pushed out of that window, or committed before the gates existed, is **not**
scanned — full-history job dropped (budget). Force-push on the current ref falls back to a
full scan of that run. `sk_<48hex>Z` is detected, `sk_<49hex>` is not. Rationale + regex:
[`scripts/kit/trufflehog-detectors.yaml`](../../scripts/kit/trufflehog-detectors.yaml).

**Where local-first does not reach.** The scan is the one gate whose local and CI forms are not
the same command: locally `scripts/kit/trufflehog-check.sh` runs a **repo-pinned** binary
(`.cache/trufflehog/<ver>/`, never `PATH`) and passes `--no-update` on every scan, since without it
TruffleHog replaces its own executable with the latest release (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#261). CI goes through the
TruffleHog **action**, which prepends `--fail --no-update --github-actions` of its own.
An argument that is valid locally can therefore be rejected in CI — measured: adding `--fail` to
`extra_args` duplicates the injected one and TruffleHog exits **1** with
`error: flag 'fail' cannot be repeated`, before scanning anything. A green `validate:full`
cannot cover this, so changes to the scan workflows are verified by replaying the action's exact
argument vector against a fixture, not by the local gate.

Note the consequence for reading failures: on this job **exit 183 means findings**, exit 1 means
the scan did not run. A step that fails identically on every commit is not a strict gate, it is
noise that gets muted — which is the same fail-open ending by a different route.

**Publication text review.** The selected control is semantic review of every final outgoing title, body and comment part, with existing-tool scanning as an additional best-effort check. TruffleHog and Gitleaks may silently skip text classified as a file format; a clean exit is not complete-byte coverage or a confidentiality proof. No mandatory publisher gate, native adapter, scanner provisioning command or new scanner dependency is provided. The TruffleHog commit/staged gate above remains unchanged.

The existing publishers remain the owners. Direct `gh` and browser writes are not intercepted; customer data without recognizable credentials, attachments and linked content require semantic review. Forms and checklists are reminders, not enforcement. GitHub scanning is detection after publication. See [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#public-safe-publication).

**Independent-lineage continuity.** The existing `test:dogfood-zero-edit` integration also exercises direct and legacy-mediated Products joining an independent public Kit root, then receiving an ordinary next upgrade. It checks actual identity/zero-edit/stack behavior, refusal of a fetched-but-unmerged pin, preservation of Product/exception/applied-migration records and absence of private ancestry in the public parent. These synthetic fixtures do not prove a final exported candidate, a real Product migration or hosted settings.

**Kit bar vs product bar**

| Gate | Scope | Who runs it |
|---|---|---|
| `bun run validate` | short kit loop — steps = root `package.json` `scripts.validate` | kit + product clones (kit zones) |
| `bun run validate:full` | kit bar (pre-push + kit CI). Steps = root `package.json` `scripts["validate:full"]` only — **do not copy that list here.** Enforced by `bun run check:bar-ssot`. **Does not** prove product apps are tested | pre-push + kit CI |
| product-validate / product-ci | product packages under `apps/<product>-*` | product repo only (copy templates; never dual-edit kit `ci.yml` / `test-coverage.sh`) |

False green: product with real apps and only kit `validate:full` green is **not** product-tested.

### Commands

```bash
bun install                    # prepare → lefthook install if hooksPath unset (no dependency postinstall runs: trustedDependencies = [])

bun run validate               # short kit loop (package.json scripts.validate)
bun run zero-edit              # product must not diverge kit paths without exception (kit = config only)
bun run env:check              # schema ↔ .dev.vars.example (DX only)
bun run i18n:check             # messages contract (also in turbo test)
bun run license:check          # dependency SPDX allowlist: live scan + --self-test (UNKNOWN = warn)
bun run test:coverage          # floors + HTML under coverage/<pkg>/
bun run validate:full          # kit bar SSoT (package.json scripts["validate:full"]) — not product apps

# Before opening a PR on the kit (explicit habit even if hooks installed):
bun run validate:full

# Product bar (product repos only — after copying templates):
# bash scripts/product/validate.sh
# See docs/kit/templates/product-validate.example.sh + product-ci.example.yml
```

### Non-negotiable local discipline

| Rule | |
|---|---|
| Install hooks | `bun install` — prepare installs only if `core.hooksPath` unset; the lefthook **postinstall** (`install -f`, [lefthook#1475](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/issues/1475)) does not run because `trustedDependencies` is `[]` (`lefthook.yml` header) |
| **Forbidden** without written reason | `git push --no-verify`, `LEFTHOOK=0` |
| **Forbidden** product hook fork | A tracked Lefthook local overlay disabling kit hooks (ADR-0013 D2); undetected does not mean permitted |
| If pre-push is red | Fix locally; do **not** “let CI tell us” |
| Docs-only exception | Still run hooks unless emergency; extract/banlist are cheap insurance |

Rationale: on Free private, branch protection is weak; **local pre-push is the process substitute**. Making CI the only full suite trains bypass culture and burns minutes on avoidable red.

### `better-sqlite3` ABI (local red herring)

Memory D1 tests load native `better-sqlite3`. After a **Node major upgrade**, suites may fail with `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch (e.g. module built for 127, runtime wants 137). That is **not** a product regression until rebuild is tried:

```bash
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
bun run validate:full
```

Historical Goal 002 exit evidence recorded this ABI mismatch; that historical evidence file is no longer in this repository.

## Risk tiers (floors + expectations)

Floors are enforced by Vitest (`packages/config/vitest-coverage.mts` + per-package `vitest.config.ts`). Runner: `scripts/kit/test-coverage.sh`.

| Tier | Scope | Floor (stmts/lines, approx.) | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T0** | `@kit/auth`, `@kit/example-api` (guards, dual auth, paths), FE **auth client** contracts | **auth 80%** · **example-api** machine floors **78/80/65/75** (stmts/lines/branches/funcs) · pin named web contract files | **Auth: never lower without ADR.** example-api: Vitest 4 v8 remapping exception (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#21) — see inventory before/after; do not lower further without ADR |
| **T1** | `core`, `storage`, `db`, `types`, `@kit/api-client`, `mcp` | **core ~68/69/66** (stmts/lines/branches) · others **70–75%** typical | Raise when surface grows; core floors recalibrated under Vitest 4 remapping (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#21) |
| **T2** | `@kit/ui`, `example-web` (page chrome) | **ui ~17/17/16/23** · **web 10/10/20/12** | Low % OK **iff** contract suites green; do not chase Button coverage; Vitest 4 remapping (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#21) |
| **T3** | `email` thin, mcp-example smoke | soft / special (e.g. funcs 0% mcp-example) | Document, don’t pretend product security |

**Vitest 4 remapping (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#21):** Same sources/tests produce lower stmt/branch % under Vitest 4.1.x v8 than 3.2.x. Floors were recalibrated just under measured values. **% is a ratchet, not the story.** The story is **critical paths** below.

---

## Ownership (axial — PRIMARY = packages)

| Layer | Owns tests for | Does **not** own |
|---|---|---|
| **`packages/*`** | Public API of the capability (crypto, AppError, `joinObjectKey`, UI primitive contracts, MCP allowlist) | Product scenarios (e.g. the reference frame's artefact, slug 409, `private_key` read mode) |
| **`apps/example-*`** | Composition: Hono + D1/R2, dual auth wire, demo IDOR, CORS, cookies, design-system smoke | Re-implement package crypto N times |
| **`apps/<product>-*`** (product repositories) | Product risks of its own domain (e.g. upload modes, archive extraction, serving product content) | Forks of `@kit/*` stacks |
| **`scripts/kit/*` / `tools/*`** | Architecture gates (kit-bar script names live in root `package.json`, not here) | Domain behaviour |

### Session-bound Impersonation

`packages/auth/src/repos/impersonation.test.ts` owns independent role permissions,
session-bound delegation persistence and transactional start/configuration audit rollback.
`apps/example-api/src/test/impersonation/{eligibility,audit,boundaries}.test.ts` composes
real Better Auth cookies, SQL migrations and SQLite: default-deny eligibility,
Organization and target boundaries, read/write business access, sensitive-route refusal,
live grant changes, stale-context refusal (including Bearer fallback attempts), mandatory
pre-dispatch audit and return despite audit failure.

Frontend contracts in `apps/example-web/src/lib/impersonation.test.ts`, `api.test.ts`
and `components/auth-gates.test.tsx` protect identity transitions, cache/request fences,
same-session synchronization and recovery-only behavior when `/me` fails. A successful
business dispatch is not implied by an audit record: the recorded action is an attempt.

Local browser proof uses the actual example UI and API with Better Auth and disposable
SQLite through the Node adapter. Observed paths include read-mode mutation refusal,
target-owned business writes, cross-tab return and recovery-only UI during a `/me`
outage. Holding successful start/stop responses after server commitment while triggering
stale-query visibility refreshes does not produce a false lifecycle failure.

This is not proof of a deployed Cloudflare runtime, external audit retention,
product-specific route admission or successful completion of every audited attempt.
Product routes must be admitted explicitly; an unlisted route remains refused.

### Notifications pure core

`packages/notifications/src/*.test.ts` exercises the public root: registration and identifier boundaries, frozen JSON parameters, access-first User resolution, specificity before cross-level locks, invalid external rules failing closed without removing Inbox, independent Organization destinations, terminal/resolved delivery eligibility and escaped email layouts with rules links in both formats.

`rule-snapshot.test.ts` protects the resolver observation boundary: changing accessor-backed rules cannot turn a captured email locked-off value on, bypass a collective ceiling or apply one changing rule Channel value to multiple Channels. Organization destination regressions reject nonmatching selectors even when the destination's selector getter or its nested `kind` getter changes during resolution. Both resolvers reuse canonical rule and destination selector values after access checks; these tests assert decisions and eligibility, not incidental property-read counts.

`apps/example-api/src/lib/notifications-dogfood.test.ts` owns composition of `tasks.assigned` and `flows.approval_requested`: App schemas/renderers, email and Slack defaults, rule overrides and distinct collective opt-ins. These declarations do not wire Notification producers or exercise a provider.

The root remains pure. E2 adds separate schema/repos exports; the following persistence proofs do not establish live membership hydration, producer wiring, Workflow execution/retries or email/Slack delivery.

### Notifications persistence

The Package repository suites cross the public `/schema` and `/repos` interfaces against all real, sorted Example App migrations with foreign keys enabled. They cover scoped Inbox visibility before pagination/count/read-all, Deployment/global-User/Organization rule ownership, atomic configuration audit and no-op suppression, active uniqueness and later-statement rollback, independent read/resolved timestamps, conditional terminal receipts and bounded retention.

`admission-reconciliation.test.ts` exercises the ADR-0020 observation contract: positive proof and first admission date are monotone, stale responses preserve the latest check time, expiry does not invent provider failure, and wrong identity or Organization cannot mutate a receipt. The unified User/Organization candidate query covers frozen `asOf`, fair strict keysets, eligibility boundaries and maximum-size ASCII cursors under the existing 512-character cap.

`cursor-keys.test.ts` and the shared core cursor regression preserve raw JSON own keys through decoding, then require the public admission and Inbox parsers to reject unknown `__proto__` keys. All three regressions failed before the shared-decoder correction and passed afterward; local workerd also exercised both rejection paths alongside ordinary valid pagination. No endpoint-specific key suppression or prototype-pollution claim is introduced.

A throwaway local Miniflare/workerd D1 smoke applied all 21 journal migrations, including `0023_notifications.sql`. Two concurrent HTTP callers admitted one active Notification/Delivery; same-ID replay did not add a Channel. It also exercised cross-Organization refusal, resolution/re-admission, later-child rollback, expiry/late proof with terminal protection, mixed-kind pagination/fairness and isolated purge. This is local D1 runtime evidence, not Cloudflare production or durable Workflow proof. The ordinary Package suites use the SQLite-backed D1 adapter and alone do not prove concurrent native D1 execution.

The pure core and persistence share the unchanged Package coverage floors. The App supplies the deterministic Workflow digest and never-reused Delivery IDs; repository validation checks identity coverage, shape and fixed deadline, not the digest computation. Purged history is not a permanent deduplication journal.

### Notifications HTTP composition

`apps/example-api/src/test/notifications/*.test.ts` crosses the shipped Hono HTTP interface with real Better Auth sessions, real org-bound keys and all applied migrations. It extends CP-IDOR/CP-UNAUTH by resource: subject/Organization isolation, session-only refusal, role/capability checks, read-only support access, live Module visibility before pagination/count/read-all, and idempotent read timestamps, including first read and replay of retained resolved rows.

The same suites exercise global User rules without administration audit, configured lock provenance independently of live availability, decisive rules beyond 100 newer rows in each of the three scopes, metadata-only Delivery lists, and atomic administration audit with no-op suppression and trigger-induced rollback. Cursor continuations cover each list with exact key validation and the largest migration-valid timestamp/id boundaries; the personal-rule endpoint actually produces and consumes its 392-character boundary cursor without crossing owners. Type/effective continuations use the largest keys produced by the fixed App registry, not hypothetical 128/64-character keys absent from that registry. Delivery creation dates also leave room for the required 24-hour admission deadline. Unicode display content remains permitted.

API catalogue tests join the existing Web catalogue tests in `i18n:check`. HTTP locale cases cover French/English, exact-header fallback, content/cache headers, trusted source links and scrubbed failures for incompatible retained parameters or missing definitions. Schema failures preserve the common field-error/request-ID envelope. All five JSON mutations reject missing and unsupported media types as safe 400 responses without writes, while preserving anonymous/session-only precedence. This regression failed with a 500 before the shared error-boundary correction. The Package's scoped `hasInboxNotification` public regression protects replay-versus-404 without an unscoped lookup; read-all retains the existing visible-row semantics.

A throwaway Miniflare/workerd smoke applied all 21 real journal migrations and exercised the actual App with native D1 and real password sign-in/cookies. It observed localized Inbox content and headers, cursor continuation, read isolation/replay, live Module/custom-role grant changes, global personal rules, a configured locked-but-unavailable preview, admin RBAC and atomic audit rollback/no-op, metadata secrecy, strict queries, media-type refusal and authenticated-key refusal. A separate Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema check accepted the actual nonempty native Deployment Delivery response, rejected unknown metadata and trailing-newline ids, and checked the projected external-Channel grammar including the `in_app` exclusion.

A managed Chromium smoke signed in an Organization owner with no Platform role, selected the run's Organization and loaded the actual Inbox approval URL in the shared App run view. The same account was redirected away from the `/admin` run entry. The navigation suite also exercises the approval request and preserves the Platform gate; link-rendered dashboard buttons retain native link semantics. These are bounded local HTTP/browser proofs, not production, source-object authorization, Workflow resumption, provider sending or durable Delivery execution.

### Notifications App service and producers

The App service suites exercise `notify` / `resolve` with real persistence adapters and all applied migrations: factual Organization/membership/Module access, external locks that preserve Inbox, actor exclusion only when supplied, full rule and destination pagination, independent collective intentions with zero User recipients, stable Delivery digests/deadlines, active deduplication and independent read/resolved state. The generic App assembly retains unconditional source resolution. E4 established the five persistence ports; E5 adds mandatory admission runtime ports and a separate real resolve-only factory.

Task regressions cross the existing HTTP mutation surface and consumed mutation-event hook. A real-HTTP tracer failed before producer wiring because the assigned recipient's Inbox was empty. A second regression reproduced a successful-path race: removal paused before its resolution SQL, a later HTTP reassignment created a notice, and the earlier removal then processed it. The Task-specific adapter now supplies trusted SQL predicates to the existing repository batch. Notification resolution and pending Delivery skips observe the same current Task/stage/assignment facts at SQL time. Regressions preserve a later new notice, an old notice reused by deduplication, its read state and pending Delivery identities; delayed post-notify removal and close/reopen compensation use the same guarded paths. The repository suites separately protect generic scope, filter/no-op semantics, both guarded lifecycle pairs and terminal Delivery preservation.

Flow producer and route regressions cover exact owner/admin recipient sets, non-admin members with Flows write, an admin retaining read but denied write, sole-owner eligibility without actor exclusion, distinct approval tuples, current sealed Runner View/receipt/decision facts, pre/post admission closure, corrupt/read failures and decision/cancellation repair. A matching configured collective destination makes closed replay assert complete unchanged Notifications and both User and Organization Delivery rows, not only Inbox counts. Resolution is still bounded best-effort: a failed compensation or exhausted callback can leave a stale notice, and a cancelled owner need not run its closing callback. Successful business writes remain committed. Producer-time object ACL/action eligibility is not continuous source-content revocation; retained parameters remain subject to ADR-0019's minimal-disclosure contract and source links still require current route authority.

A throwaway Miniflare/workerd smoke applied all 21 real journal migrations, obtained real Better Auth cookies and exercised the actual App, native D1 and actual `FlowRunWorkflow`: Task assignment/lifecycle and Inbox isolation, pending Delivery identity/deadline metadata, approval/cancellation and direct public-callback replay after closure without restarting the original owner. Instrumentation only at the Workflow's notification-service boundary observed two controlled opening failures followed by creation on attempt three, and four exhausted failures followed by a waiting D1 approval and successful business execution after approval. The class and P2 native steps were unchanged. A separate controlled `sendEvent` failure proved decision persistence, immediate resolution and closed-state replay; this is not a claim that native termination makes wake fail—the local runtime accepted that wake.

The same native D1 smoke paused a historical Task removal immediately before its real guarded resolution, completed reassignment through HTTP, then resumed the earlier operation. The fresh active Inbox row and its pending Delivery rows remained byte-for-byte unchanged, including Workflow identity, fixed deadline and admission receipt fields. This exercises the SQL-time guard on native D1, in addition to the permanent SQLite-adapter race regressions.

The extended native closed-replay proof also configured a matching collective Slack destination, captured complete resolved Notifications and both Delivery kinds, and independently checked the collective Workflow digest and fixed deadline. Reinvoking the public opening callback left all three scoped row sets unchanged.

These are bounded local proofs, not Cloudflare production, provider sending, a new UI surface or durable Delivery execution. E4 persists real `pending` intentions with fixed 24-hour admission horizons but creates no Delivery owner and performs no admission reconciliation. If E5 arrives after that original horizon, an E4 intention is not eligible for a newly created owner merely because it remains pending; automatic eventual sending is not promised.

### Notifications email Delivery owner

The App's `notifications-delivery` suites exercise stable identity, deadline rechecks, monotone admission, strict native-result projection, terminal protection, unsupported slots, retry-envelope validation and email classification. Service regressions preserve postcommit results, fresh-only handoff and sibling continuation. Their explicit memory Workflow adapter models identity/presence; it does not execute a native Workflow.

A throwaway Miniflare/workerd smoke applied all 21 real migrations, used real Better Auth cookies and crossed the actual Task HTTP producer into `NotificationDeliveryWorkflow`, native D1 and a controlled local EMAIL RPC service. It exercised response-lost and concurrent admission, retained terminal replay, missing/foreign rows, strict completion output and before/at/after-horizon admission. An isolated public instance deletion models post-retention absence: the old intention is not rearmed. It is not proof of automatic retention expiry.

The same native smoke exercised fresh address hydration and current membership, Module and rules on retry, including a rule beyond the first 100 rows; source resolution won the final receipt CAS. Local transport acceptance followed by lost acknowledgement produced a possible duplicate. A checkpointed send followed by a trigger-induced finish failure completed through native finish retry without a second physical send. A documented structured CF permanent error produced a failed receipt; unknown interruptions remained retryable.

An isolated actual `NotificationDeliveryWorkflow` run exhausted its native send policy with unmodified timers: exactly six physical local EMAIL calls, then native completion with `failed/delivery_retries_exhausted`. The App and D1 did not drive a retry loop, and no private timer acceleration or owner restart was used.


Native D1 maintenance exercised one unified page of 100 old candidates, sibling-Organization progress after an isolated purge failure and the pre-cascade child state through a test-only delete observer. The actual Worker `scheduled` handler was also invoked with a future `scheduledTime`, preserving the server clock, page bound and sibling isolation. The Package retention suite separately proves batch selection, terminal preservation, Organization isolation and rollback. The existing server Organization inventory is not globally bounded; only each Organization's reconciliation page and purge batch are bounded.

The approved D6 amendment is separately exercised by the actual production retry helpers inside the native engine: a 75.25-second hint schedules 76,000 milliseconds and the unaccelerated callback occurs no earlier. Explicit constant backoff prevents the runtime's default multiplier from changing the dynamic schedule. No undocumented timer controls are used. These are local runtime proofs, not Cloudflare production, effective account retention, recipient receipt or exactly-once guarantees. Default native success/error retention must still be operationally verified before deployment.

A native component proof uses real E2 rows and the production retry-result helper: a hint above 86,400 seconds returns `failed/retry_after_exceeds_budget` in one callback, without a retry. A rejected diagnostic D1 write preserves a 75.25-second hint and the native 76,000-millisecond delay. The result is controlled at the component boundary; unchanged `EmailPort` has no provider-hint field, so this is not an end-to-end provider-hint claim.

An isolated staging runtime exercises the actual owner with explicit synthetic HTTPS origins and controlled EMAIL RPC: allowed recipients preserve the staging subject prefix, From and both footer formats; a disallowed domain fails without a transport call. The initial fixture's loopback origins were rejected by the existing non-development policy; the fixture, not that policy, was corrected.


E5 composes only User/email. Unsupported Slack and Organization/email intentions remain uncertain until their original admission window closes, without a fabricated provider failure. The authenticated footer currently opens `/api/me/notification-rules` on the configured API origin; no E6a preferences UI, public unsubscribe route or real provider delivery is claimed.




### Shared test support

Share technical mechanics, not a global scenario or mock framework. Keep fixtures inside the Package or App that owns their data.

| Seam | Shared support | Remains local |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite-backed D1 | `@kit/db/testing` (`createSqliteD1`), separate from the production entry point | DDL or real migrations, foreign-key mode, records and database lifetime in each wrapper |
| API composition | `apps/example-api/src/test/api-fixture.ts`: app/env/db composition, demo seed options, sign-in and request headers | Scenario data, historical migrations, R2 and Workflow doubles |
| Web pages and hooks | `apps/example-web/src/test/`: provider harness, lightweight `query-client.ts` registry, fresh QueryClient and memory history, Me/Organization factories, strict `apiFetch` dispatcher | Plans, runs, Role–module grants and concurrency scenarios |

Synthetic API fixtures may inject `hashFixtureCredential` from the App's test support. Its in-memory promises reuse the real hasher's immutable result for an exact synthetic password within that loaded file instance; rejected entries are evicted and the helper rethrows to its caller. The seeders' pre-existing best-effort catch behavior is unchanged. Same-password fixture accounts deliberately share salt and hash, but databases, records and sessions remain fresh. Default seed calls, credential creation, password changes, sign-in and verification retain real crypto. The default-seed salt and cross-context reset oracles protect that boundary; this fixture optimization is not proof of independent salts for fixture accounts.

For client error contracts, cover both `ApiError` envelopes and non-envelope
`HttpError` responses, including status-based consumer behavior and 401 callbacks
whose synchronous or asynchronous failures must not replace the HTTP rejection.
Keep network failures distinct from HTTP responses; never rely on raw error bodies
as user-facing messages.

- **API:** request `Cookie` uses cookie pairs; raw `Set-Cookie` remains response data for flag assertions. Pass the Organization explicitly when required. In Flows fixtures, `provisionOperatorWriteOnAcmeOverHttp` requires HTTP `201`; `seedOperatorWriteOnAcme` establishes a DB precondition. Choose the layer deliberately — no HTTP-to-repository fallback.
- **Web:** declare method/path handlers at the `apiFetch` seam; unexpected requests fail teardown even if a query catches the rejection. Client HTTP-contract tests keep the real client seam. Render errors fail too: an intentional negative case declares a narrow, test-scoped `allowRuntimeError` that must actually match an observed error. RegExp allowances are evaluated as stateless predicates, including global/sticky patterns. The shared renderer records caught errors before invoking a caller's `onCaughtError`; a callback cannot suppress the guard. Logs remain visible. Route tests await destination content, not just an updated URL or an absent fallback. `apps/example-web/src/test/support-guards.test.tsx` exercises the guard contracts with real caught render errors, caller callbacks and swallowed unexpected requests.
- **Lifetime:** the D1 adapter owns no Vitest hooks. Wrappers register `onTestFinished` immediately after each native SQLite allocation, before pragma, DDL or migrations can throw; the real-D1 fixture disposes Miniflare, including failed startup. The shared Web outer `aroundEach` owns capture and aggregate cleanup, so an ordinary failing consumer teardown does not skip support cleanup or erase the original failure. It unmounts DOM before clearing caches and restoring globals, spies, environment, clocks and storage, even after a guard fails. The next-consumer test retains a populated QueryClient across a failing teardown and checks that its cache was cleared. Spies and globals are restored before ending capture, which restores the captured console method only if its wrapper is still installed on that same object and detaches listeners from their original attachment target. Explicit guard assertions validate and drain the ledger without ending capture; only the outer finalizer releases it. Cleanup runs after consumer finish callbacks; its failures do not retroactively invoke `onTestFailed`. Shared setup also supports per-file Node environments: browser listeners and storage are used only when a DOM exists, while console-error capture and non-DOM cleanup remain active.

Console-mock compatibility covers spies created on the captured console method. A retained Vitest mock predecessor uses its public `mockRestore()` before a second ownership check, so composed suite/body spies cannot reinstall a retired predecessor; ordinary direct logger predecessors remain intact. This carries Vitest's reset semantics: standalone `vi.fn` configuration is not preserved losslessly, and a borrowed spy's restorer retains its original target. It is not a general mock-owner resolver.

`apps/example-web/src/test/shared-finalization.test.ts` runs a non-discovered failure fixture through the real Web configuration in an isolated child process. It requires separate consumer/finalizer diagnostics, a successful following consumer, restored storage and a visible body marker. The child deliberately exits `1`; the ordinary parent test must pass. Only this failure-fixture child disables coverage; ordinary Web coverage and thresholds are unchanged. The runner derives the executed fixture's include path from `import.meta.url`, so Knip sees the actual dynamic entry without changing analyzer defaults or ignores.

`packages/db/src/sqlite-d1.test.ts` runs the same binding scenarios against the adapter and **actual local D1** through pinned Miniflare/workerd. It belongs to ordinary Package `test` and `test:coverage`, not an opt-in command, and needs no Cloudflare credentials. It is a bounded binding-contract proof, not a substitute for migration, deployment-configuration or remote-D1 verification.

### Design-system e2e (local only)

- **Kit composition proof** (`@kit/ui` + admin shell in `example-web`).
- **Not** product e2e. Do not grow it into artefact/upload flows.
- **Local (API + web already up):** `bun run test:e2e:design-system` — fast when stack is warm.
- **Local one-shot (cold start):** `bun run test:e2e:ci` (`scripts/kit/e2e-ci.sh` — migrate, seed, start API+web, Chromium smoke, teardown).
- **Not** in GitHub Actions CI, `validate:full`, or Lefthook pre-push — Free minutes + flake risk; local-first gate stays machine-cheap.
- **CP-E2E** — proves: BA cookie login path + design-system overlays open without Base UI contract console errors. **Does not prove:** dual-auth, IDOR, org RBAC, product flows, a11y matrix.

### When product lands

- Product tests live only under `apps/<product>-*`.
- Kit banlist + extract remain green; product debt must not lower kit T0 floors.
- A product's own risks (for the reference frame: zip-slip, `private_key` → 404) become **mandatory product tests** when its code lands — not pre-baked as product fixtures inside packages.

## Auth test seams (ADR-0002)

Do not lock Better Auth internals forever. Lock **stable wire**:

| Seam | Where | Stable? |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Crypto / session / key hash | `packages/auth` unit | **Stable contract** — BA session + `sk_` hash; do not lock BA internals forever |
| 2. Dual path HTTP (cookie + `sk_`) + cookie flags + IDOR | `apps/example-api` integration | **Stable** |
| 3. FE wire: `credentials: 'include'`, envelope map, 401 | `apps/example-web` `lib/api*` (+ auth helpers) | **Stable** |

UI chrome (layout, design-system catalog) is not seam 3.

### Authentication regressions

Authentication changes must preserve the session, Organization isolation and authorization
seams exercised by the permanent regression tests below. Local Example App coverage does not
prove that an external Product has adopted the Kit or that a deployment has migrated.

Permanent `auth-session-regression.test.ts` and `auth-org-regression.test.ts` use the real
Example App HTTP seam and database state changes: missing/invalid/expired/deleted sessions,
refresh/cookies and next-request revocation, alternating identities and Organizations,
nonmember response privacy, suspended members, live membership/Platform Role changes, an
unbound legacy key and audited super-admin read/write break-glass. Existing `app.test.ts`,
`org-rbac.test.ts`, `org-roles-phase-b.test.ts`, `auth-throttle.test.ts`, `flows.test.ts` and
`tasks.test.ts` retain key, Module and custom-role coverage. The nonmember/suspended case was
observed failing with 403 before the change and passing with 404 afterward.

## Critical path inventory (CP-*)

Machine-enforced today via full `validate` + `test:coverage` + package tests. Prefer tests whose names/files map to these IDs. When adding `test:critical`, filter this set.

| ID | Behaviour | Primary home |
|---|---|---|
| **CP-AUTH-KEY** | mint / hash / verify `sk_`; reject bad key | `packages/auth`, example-api |
| **CP-AUTH-SESSION** | sign/verify session; cookie HttpOnly · Secure (prod) · SameSite; requireAuth | `packages/auth`, example-api |
| **CP-AUTH-DUAL** | cookie **or** Bearer reaches `/api/me` / protected routes | example-api |
| **CP-AUTH-THROTTLE** | SQLite-backed public admission tests cover native IP/session rules, actor-source isolation, shared e-mail budgets, persisted counters and fail-closed errors; the Example App suite exercises the native mount. This does not prove production D1 or deployment, OAuth authentication, or e-mail delivery | `packages/auth/src/repos/ba-throttle.test.ts`, `packages/auth/src/repos/ba-throttle-actor.test.ts`, `apps/example-api/src/auth-throttle.test.ts` |
| **CP-IDOR** | subject B cannot read/mutate A’s resource (notes + **org invitations** cross-tenant cancel; **each new resource** must extend). Task comments (list, create, delete) require the `tasks` grant as well as `comments`: a cookie-session role holding `comments` write without `tasks` gets 403 `Insufficient module grant` and writes nothing, the same role with `tasks` read gets them back; with the `tasks` module not effective for the org they answer 404 `Module not available` | example-api (`invitations.test.ts`, notes IDOR, `tasks.test.ts`) |
| **CP-TASKS-ISOLATION** | `@kit/tasks` repos run on the **real applied migrations with FKs on** (not hand DDL); every repo function that touches an existing row has a cross-org negative (`deleteTask`, `replaceAssignees`, `listAssigneesForTasks`, `insertLink`, `updateTask` cannot move `orgId`); assignees must be members of the task org (400, nothing written); 0018 backfill and the 0019 purge + composite FKs are covered on mismatched rows. Deleting a task deletes its comments and no other `kit_comments` row: the other task's, another org's on the same target id, another target type's on the same id, and the caller's own row on a stolen id (404) all stay (example-api, applied migrations). `@kit/comments` `deleteByTarget` removes only its (org, type, id) target (package memory D1, hand DDL; `kit_comments` has no FK). Extends **CP-IDOR** for assignees | `packages/tasks` (`repos.test.ts`), `packages/comments` (`repos.test.ts`), example-api (`tasks.test.ts`, `tasks-org-migration.test.ts`) |
| **CP-TASKS-HELPERS** | Pure link validation rejects reflexive links, duplicates, second parents and cycles within one Organization and link kind; other Organizations' links do not contribute issues. Board stages are scoped by Organization and board, sorted by position then id without mutating the input; membership checks use the same scope. Does not prove persisted-row authorization (see **CP-TASKS-ISOLATION**) | `packages/tasks` (`links.test.ts`, `stages.test.ts`) |
| **CP-UNAUTH** | protected mutations without auth → 401 `UNAUTHORIZED` | example-api |
| **CP-FLOWS-CANCEL** | `POST /api/flows/runs/:id/cancel`: session owner/admin CAS `queued|running→cancelled` + best-effort terminate; member/`sk_` → 403; other org → 404; already cancelled → 200 idempotent; `succeeded|failed` → 409; terminate failure keeps cancelled. Extends **CP-IDOR** / **CP-UNAUTH** for this resource | example-api (`flows-cancel.test.ts`) |
| **CP-ERR** | nested `{ error: { code, message }, requestId }`; no stack leak; D1 unique (including PRIMARY KEY) is 409 only when `@kit/db` `isUniqueConstraintError` sees `(extended: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE\|PRIMARYKEY)` on a `D1_ERROR:` message, else the engine prefix at the start of a cause — not bound params, not `.code` | `packages/core`, `packages/db` (`sqlite-error.test.ts`), example-api (`flows-v2.test.ts`) |
| **CP-D1-TEST-ADAPTER** | The same fake/local-D1 scenarios prove independent bound statements, ordered bare-write batches, rollback after a later failure, and consumed read/write results. Does not prove the full D1 API, migration equivalence or deployed Worker configuration | `packages/db/src/sqlite-d1.test.ts` (ordinary Package tests and coverage) |
| **CP-CORS** | evil Origin not reflected; no `*` + credentials | example-api |
| **CP-SECRET** | fail-closed `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` outside development\|test | example-api + `packages/auth` |
| **CP-R2** | keys under intended prefix; invalid segments rejected before I/O; one unconsumed GET streams binary bytes and content type through `Response`, missing objects return null | `packages/storage`, example-api |
| **CP-FE-CRED** | `apiFetch` always `credentials: 'include'`; maps UNAUTHORIZED | example-web |
| **CP-FLOWS-RETRY-READ** | kit invoke `retries.limit` is `3` iff sealed `RunnerView.toolEffects[tool] === 'read'`; `write`, omitted effect, absent/`{}` `toolEffects`, and all-write seals (map omitted) are `0`; a retry-honoring step double proves a sealed-read port throw is retried (second attempt ok) or, after the limit, writes `INVOKE_FAILED`; `contentDigest` / mint allowlist unchanged when only `effect` flips. **Does not** prove Cloudflare Workflows actually retried a live step, nor that a `started` receipt (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#229) is not replayed | `packages/flows` `registry.test.ts` · `run/drive.test.ts` · [ADR-0005](./architecture/adr/0005-flows-platform-agentic-workflows.md) D4 |
| **CP-FLOWS-APPROVAL-NOTICE** | Optional opened/closed ports use stable org/run/task identity; waiting precedes opening and the winning D1 decision precedes closure. Real callback failures reach bounded owner retries with scrubbed errors; exhaustion logs and preserves business outcomes, deadlines and the eight-wake budget. Replay permits repeated callback invocation, not exactly-once delivery or guaranteed closure after forced termination. The permanent suites use a memoizing/retrying owner double, not live Cloudflare | `packages/flows/src/run/drive-approval-notifications.test.ts` · `approve-notifications-replay.test.ts`; separate local Wrangler Workflow/D1 smoke observed 3 opening attempts before success, 4 exhausted closing attempts followed by downstream execution, and 8 wakes before unchanged expiration despite both callbacks exhausting |
| **CP-MCP-REG** | live registered names / `tools/list` equals app catalogue.names; planted extra tool fails assert | `packages/mcp` catalogue unit + `bun run smoke:mcp` |
| **CP-MCP-SMOKE** | stdio JSON-RPC list + ping + whoami; whoami body matches `whoamiResultSchema`; no `sk_` in result | `bun run smoke:mcp` (in `validate:full` / CI) |
| **CP-MCP-REFUSAL** | explicit refusal produces `isError`, matching structured payload and JSON text; ordinary `ok: false` and lookalikes stay successful; malformed payloads and unexpected exceptions are redacted | `packages/mcp/src/catalogue.test.ts` and `apps/mcp-example/src/refusal-transport.test.ts`: package unit and real Edge request / stdio JSON-RPC child through the example catalogue |
| **CP-MCP-HTTP-OAUTH** | hosted `POST /mcp` 401 + `resource_metadata` challenge naming `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`; RFC 9728 this host = resource **and** AS, `scopes_supported` `mcp`; PKCE + localhost DCR (or CIMD) + demo identity → Worker token with `expires_in` 28800; `tools/list` ping/whoami; `ping` ok. `packages/mcp/src/hosted/create-worker.test.ts` proves the authorization-server options as the provider applies them (S256-only PKCE, no implicit flow or token exchange, 8-hour `expires_in`, refresh grant stored for `refreshTokenTTL` or the provider default, an out-of-range `refreshTokenTTL` refused at creation), client-bound error redirects only after the identity port authenticates, consent binding, the redirect-class warning (custom schemes included), the `400` before the identity port or a consent record for http redirects off the provider's loopback hosts, Deny, cookies, `skip` only with a visible `createProductClient` receipt (open DCR, bare `createClient`, and a client-visible/receipt-null schedule keep the page), reserved paths, the configured origin (`MCP_PUBLIC_URL`: reserved paths `404` on every other origin, cleartext and a Host the provider cannot build on included; `500` on every origin while it is missing off a loopback development host or is neither an https origin nor an http one on loopback; product routes reach the hook in both cases; a loopback http origin served whether unset or configured), and loopback two-origin env handling; `packages/mcp/src/hosted-isolation.test.ts` proves root `@kit/mcp` loads neither hosted peer. **Non-claim:** consent single use is best effort at KV strength: get→delete is not atomic, so a replay inside KV visibility can complete only the same client, redirect URI, and PKCE challenge; only the original verifier holder can redeem. | `apps/mcp-example/src/http-oauth.test.ts` (package `test`, **not** `smoke:mcp`) for connect; the named `packages/mcp` tests for shell contracts |
| **CP-MCP-CONSENT-PRESENTATION** | Optional French presentation and App-owned disclosures share the existing protected form; hostile text stays escaped and caller mutation after construction cannot change later pages. French Allow/Deny preserve CSRF rejection, GET-bound identity/client/redirect/PKCE and cookie cleanup; localized redirect-class warnings remain present | `packages/mcp/src/hosted/create-worker.test.ts`: public-handler/provider tests with isolated in-memory KV |
| **CP-MCP-SCHEMA** | public Zod outs + public tool error codes on kit wrap paths | `packages/mcp` unit (`catalogue.test.ts`, handlers) |

| **CP-TSCONFIG-ORPHAN** | two invariants, one gate. **Coverage:** every tracked `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` outside `{apps,packages}/<ws>/src/` is opened by the root project (`tsc --listFilesOnly`). **Citation:** in every workspace, each *runnable* `tsconfig*.json` at its root is named by that workspace's own `typecheck` script — runnable = declares `files`/`include`/`references` (a base declaring none is skipped structurally, not by filename), a bare `tsc --noEmit` counts as citing `tsconfig.json`, a script citing a project that does not exist fails too, and a project present in the checkout is audited before it is staged. A workspace with tracked `src/` and no runnable project fails (the `src/` subtraction otherwise assumes a project that does not exist). A citation counts only when `tsc`/`tsgo`/`vue-tsc` is in the same command as `-p`/`-b`; swallowing tsc's status (or-true, a pipe) does not count. Citation closes the hole the `{apps,packages}/<ws>/src/` subtraction opens: `apps/example-web` ships two programs (browser `tsconfig.json` + Node `tsconfig.test.json`), `turbo typecheck` runs the script and nothing else, so dropping half that script silently removed 22 test files from typechecking. Self-test plants a tracked orphan then greens it by extending `include`, and plants both citation directions (cited → 0, uncited/phantom/no-project/echo-p/swallowed-exit → 1) in throwaway `git init` trees; untracked `.ts` and a missing/unloadable project fail-closed. **Does not** prove the covering project's `compilerOptions` are right (only that a project covers the file), **does not** look inside workspace projects — a workspace `exclude` can still orphan its own `src/` files — and **does not** audit projects nested below a workspace root. **Scope:** the orphan inventory remains `{ts,tsx,mts,cts}` only. Separately, root `tsconfig.json` enables `allowJs` + `checkJs` and explicitly includes `scripts/kit/lib/merge-gate.cjs`, `scripts/kit/lib/product-declaration.cjs` and `scripts/kit/lib/latest-run.cjs`; `typecheck:tooling` checks the whole root program, including JavaScript imported by a root TypeScript file.

A planted `any` and a complexity-16 function fail. `noVoid` stays **off** (`void` is the floating-promise marker; deleting it would hide the float). `useMaxParams` stays **off** (org/actor/audience coordinates are the isolation signature, not a bag). **Nursery stays unset** — measured 2026-09-29: 4643 warnings, mostly `useExplicitType` / `useExplicitReturnType` / `useConsistentFunctionStyle`. The static contract reads the actual root config; five global-rule plants use an exact config and `.gitignore` snapshot in a temporary directory. The installed local Biome is required and a nonempty `BIOME_BINARY` override is refused. The full actual-root lint remains first in `validate:full`. A future path-, project-, VCS-, import- or extends-sensitive oracle must restore the actual context it needs. Existing functions over the complexity cap are a **mitigation**: grandfathered `biome-ignore` + `DEBT:cog-*`, not a fix. The count is ratcheted by `config/kit/debt-ceilings.json` (`check-debt.ts`): more markers fail and name the site; fewer fail until the ceiling is lowered.

Knip also merges a root `package.json#knip` key under `knip.ts` and takes the workspace set from a root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; both paths are `protected_files`, and a product root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is FORBIDDEN (**CP-DOGFOOD**).

Not claimed: agreement with other YAML readers (js-yaml, PyYAML) or another Bun (CI pins `package.json#packageManager`; a local `bun` may differ); rendering by a Markdown engine other than the pinned Bun's, such as GitHub's cmark-gfm; a status word the decision shows without parentheses (emphasis, prose) or with a lookalike letter; that a prose `related` entry names something real; that two ADR files never share a number; `docs/kit/README.md` ADR labels; that the git index matches a commit; what a mount point inside the checkout holds; the same verdict on a case-insensitive or Unicode-normalizing filesystem, where the worktree and the git index can spell one name differently (CI runs Linux); where the `.git` directory or the git index came from (a `.git` directory or index copied from another repository, a stale registration of another repository that `git worktree repair` re-attaches to the root, or one written by hand, counts as the root's own); an ownership check of its own (a host whose `safe.directory` trusts the repository, such as GitHub's runner image with `*`, lets it through); the wording of a git error, which the caller's locale or a `GIT_TRACE*` variable tracing to stderr can change; that the header's prose matches the code (the census ties each rule id to one literal and a passing case, not a sentence, a branch or a message, and a second site that builds an id from parts escapes it); that a violation fits one line (an `adr/` entry name holding a line break splits it, Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#384 RC-9); normativity or an axial marker shown in a decision cell; a status copied outside the index, `docs/kit/product-consumer-contract.md` included; or *which* ADR is axial (the extraction dry run pins ADR-0001). **Qualified refs:** tracked Markdown and the comments and messages of code and config carry no bare `#N` (`owner/repo#N` or a full URL; the sha256-pinned applied migrations (`.sql` under a `migrations` directory) excluded, a line marked `qualified-refs:ignore` is data); the same detector backs the commitlint rule that rejects a bare `#N` in a commit header, body or footer. The local commit-msg runner pins `commitlint.config.cjs`, isolates cosmiconfig's process cwd, and exports the checkout `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` so `core.commentChar` still applies; `test-qualified-refs.sh` executes Lefthook in Git fixtures with permissive configs, executable meta configs, JSON meta options and a non-hash comment character, proving rejection of bare refs and acceptance of clean messages (ADR-0013 amendment 2026-10-13, Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#429).

| **CP-LOCK-RANGES** | every workspace's `dependencies` / `devDependencies` / `optionalDependencies` range, as `bun.lock` records it for that workspace (`workspaces[…]`, root `""` included — not read from `package.json`), admits the version `bun.lock` resolved for it: the nested `<workspace name>/<dep>` entry before the hoisted `<dep>`; a root `overrides[dep]` is the effective spec when present; protocol specs (`workspace:`, `catalog:`, `file:`, `link:`, `tarball:`, `npm:` aliases, git and URLs), npm's prefix-less git shorthand (`owner/repo[#ref]`) and paths (`./`, `../`, `~/`, `/`), wildcards and dist-tags are skipped; a range with no entry and a spec that is not a range fail; each finding names workspace, dependency, range, version and its repair — `bun update <dep>` for a resolution, a spec rewrite for a spec that is not a range. The Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#319 shape (hoisted `0.12.0` under a workspace `^0.10.0`) fails. An entry that resolves another package's name, a lock with no root workspace `""`, and a scan that checks no range fail; `package.json` launches the gate with `bun --no-env-file --config=config/kit/bunfig.gates.toml`, so neither a tree `.env` nor a tree `bunfig.toml` (`preload`, `define`) can set `LOCK_RANGES_ROOT` (the self-test runs that launch line against a decoy `.env` and a decoy `bunfig.toml` preload). **Does not** prove that bun.lock's workspace record matches `package.json` (owned by `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, which refuses a lock that disagrees with the manifests), peer ranges, the ranges a package declares for its own dependencies, an `npm:` alias's target range, nor that `bun install` re-checks a kept version (it does not) | `bun run lock-ranges:check` · `scripts/kit/check-lock-ranges.ts` · `bun run test:lock-ranges` (in `validate:full`) |
| **CP-STACK-CONTRACT** | product-owned `.dev/stack.yml` is not byte-equal to upstream; kit mode checks shape and that every `livré` package named in a `docs/kit/standards/stack.md` row is in `bun.lock` (`cible` / `option produit` / `fermé` rows must be absent), including aligned table cells; product mode rejects a new roster `never`, a lower `max_agents`, any `landing.required_checks`, a bad `landing.mode`, a pinned `commands.*` change or removal, any `bun.*version` key, a non-canonical roster/landing shape, and an unfilled `name` / `backend.path` / `frontend.path` / `release.component`. An API-only product may replace the whole `frontend` block with the canonical null scalar `frontend: null` and keeps that scalar on upgrade; no frontend App is required. The guard compares values, not filesystem existence. `~`, implicit empty, `Null`, a quoted string, a missing key, a partial map, and a null or blank `frontend.path` still fail (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#591). The compared base must not descend from the commit that introduced `config/product/inheritance.json` (covers a base whose tree holds the marker and the delete-and-re-add launder; a shallow clone counts as a hit). **Does not** prove `upstreamCommit` is a kit tip: a base that predates the marker's introduction is accepted (ADR-0009 D4 threat model) | `bun run stack-contract:check` · `bun run test:stack-contract` (in `validate:full`) |

An OR needs one proven operand; an AND needs every operand proven. The only recognized atoms are exact `always()` and `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` or `github.event_name == 'push'` (either operand order); other atoms and functions are not presumed true. The template's draft-PR condition passes because its push atom proves the OR. A shape it does not model is a finding, never skipped: a `push` that is neither null nor a mapping, `branches` that are not strings (an unquoted `!main` parses as null), a job that is not a mapping, a `needs` naming no job, a local `uses: ./…` callee that is not a file under `.github/workflows/` or is already in its call chain, a remote job-level `uses:` (it cannot be opened). A local callee's jobs, nested callees included, are judged by the same job rules (`if`, `needs`, `uses:`, `continue-on-error`) in the caller's push context. Kit `ci.yml` and `secret-scan.yml` are judged by those push and job rules without the Product CI name rule. An undeclared product workflow file is admissible unless the local `refs/remotes/origin/deploy/<SOURCE_BRANCH>` snapshot still requires it: a retained runnable file passes, a premature deletion or an invalid trigger fails, and deletion passes only after that snapshot no longer lists the path. ENOENT on `.git`, or a missing deploy ref, is bootstrap; a present marker with a git failure (including exit 128) or a malformed deployed declaration refuses. `continue-on-error` on an inspected job, step, or callee is a finding unless it is boolean false; absent is accepted. A local callee whose `on` has no `workflow_call` (string, list entry, or mapping key) is a finding even when the tree is not a git project. When that semantic check is clean, `--check` runs pinned actionlint 1.7.12 (`config/kit/actionlint.version`, never PATH) with `-config-file config/kit/actionlint.yaml`, so a product `.github/actionlint.yaml` cannot ignore expression or reusable-call syntax errors.

| **CP-FALSIFY** | healthy oracle baseline; failed tests (not import/0-test infra) when `isGlobOrNullOrigin` neutered; restore + re-green. Counts any failed test with a message | `bun run test:falsify` · `bash scripts/kit/test-falsify.sh --self-test` |
| **CP-ENV** | **Kit only:** `apps/example-api` Worker string keys documented in `apps/example-api/.dev.vars.example` (SSoT Zod schema) + root Vite placeholders; no real secrets in examples. **Does not** cover product apps’ env inventories | `bun run env:check` — **DX only**, example-api scoped; not “prod secrets validated”, not product-wide |
| **CP-LICENSE** | third-party deps on allowlist; a disallowed SPDX expression fails (exit 1). The evaluator is fail-closed: `AND` binds tighter than `OR`, grouping is honoured, and a malformed expression (lowercase/unknown operator, juxtaposed atoms, stray parenthesis, over 512 chars or 20 `(`) is a violation instead of reading as its first operand. A package.json `license` string, its `{ type }` object form and a `licenses[]` of strings or objects are all read. An empty scan, a bad policy or a `--root` outside the self-test child exits 2; `QG_LICENSE_ROOT` cannot move the scan root. Policy key `allowedLicenses` (or `allowlist`) in `.license-policy.json`. `--self-test` plants each shape (string, object, `licenses[]` objects/strings, `(MIT) AND GPL-3.0-only`, four malformed expressions) in a temp tree under an MIT-only policy and requires exit 1 naming exactly that package, plus the empty-scan / `--root` / env-root guards | `bun run license:check` (in `validate:full`) runs the live scan then `bun scripts/kit/licenseChecker.ts --self-test` — **compliance hygiene**, not malware audit |
| **CP-I18N** | Kit `example-web` FR/EN non-empty copy + key parity (`Messages`); `LocaleSwitcher` hidden when one catalog | `messages.contract.test.ts` / `i18n:check` · `packages/i18n` + `LocaleSwitcher` unit — **not** semantic/security review |
| **CP-UI-CONTRACT** | known Base UI traps (e.g. MenuGroupContext, closed dialog) | `packages/ui` (+ design-system smoke) |
| **CP-E2E** | BA cookie login + design-system overlays (Chromium); no Base UI contract console errors | **Local only:** `test:e2e:design-system` / `test:e2e:ci` — **not** dual-auth / IDOR / RBAC; not a CI gate |
| **CP-FLOWS-RECEIPT-LOST** | an effect step calls its port only from an absent receipt, after committing `started`; re-entry on `started` (queued, running, or already-terminal run), `ok` or `fail` makes 0 port calls; `started` is rewritten to `fail`/`RECEIPT_LOST` (receipt-only when the run is already terminal) and a recorded `ok`/`fail` is unchanged; `approve` open writes `waiting` and never `started`; `started` is never ready and never rolled up `succeeded` or `running`; a replay over a stale memoized load, a leftover `started` at the terminal write, a throw after the marker, and a cancel that races the orphan close all scrub leftover `started` (open runs end `failed` with `error_code=RECEIPT_LOST`); a write under a foreign `org_id` changes 0 rows. **Does not** prove CF step memoization or engine retry behaviour; at-most-once against two concurrent executions of one step (`persistRunBundle` is a read-modify-write, not a CAS); or that a lost `started` acknowledgement cannot produce a spurious `RECEIPT_LOST` | `packages/flows` `interpret.test.ts`, `run/receipt-lost.test.ts`, `run/receipt-slot.test.ts`, `run/receipt-lost-drive.test.ts`, `run/approve-step.test.ts` |
| **CP-FLOWS-PLAN-VERSION** | Republish identity is the posted YAML bytes (one atomic D1 `INSERT … WHERE NOT EXISTS` on `(org_id, plan_key, yaml_source)`, then a SHA-256-confirmed re-read of the lowest byte-equal version), not FNV `plan_digest` and not parse equality. Identical bytes → 200 with the same id/version and no new row, **including two staggered, overlapping publishes** and a version-unique failure that re-reads the same bytes. Different bytes (same parse, seeded unequal `yaml_source`, null `yaml_source`, overlapping) → 201 as version max+1. Matches are org-scoped even when another org stores a lower version. A version-unique failure whose re-read finds different (or no) bytes → 409 `PLAN_VERSION_RACE` retryable; id collisions are not that oracle. `checkPlan` runs first. **Does not** prove D1 statement atomicity on Cloudflare (tests use SQLite in memory), in-flight snapshot immutability, or grant mint. **Does not** kill the SHA-256 re-check: it is equivalent to the BINARY `=` compare | `apps/example-api` `flows-plan-version.test.ts` · `flows-v2.test.ts` |
| **CP-FLOWS-EVENTS** | every successful claim / terminal persist / workflow-create-fail CAS appends an org-scoped `flow_run_events` row (`status` or `receipt`); `listFlowRunEvents` without the run org is empty; schema has no `output` column; repo exports insert+list only. **Does not** prove CF transaction batching or a timeline HTTP API | `packages/flows` `repos.events.test.ts` |
| **CP-FLOWS-MODELS** | infer plans fail check unless every effective model id (`task.infer.model ?? plan.model`, every infer task) is in the minted `FLOW_ALLOWED_MODELS` list; unset or empty list + infer is `EMPTY_MODELS`; a body `allowedModels` field is a strict-body 400, not the grant; the InferPort receives the inherited `plan.model`; a malformed list is 500 for infer plans and ignored for invoke-only plans. **Does not** prove a provider rejected the call, that runtime infer re-checks the id, or that a list change affects an already sealed run | `packages/flows` `check.test.ts` · `apps/example-api` `flows-v3.test.ts`, `flows-grant.test.ts`, `flows-run/infer.test.ts` |
| **CP-FLOWS-BIND** | whole-value `${{ tasks.<id>.output }}` only; partial → `BINDING_NOT_WHOLE`; secret-shaped keys → `ARG_KEY_FORBIDDEN`; unknown binding target → `UNKNOWN_TASK_EDGE`; A↔B via bindings → `CYCLE`; sealed `after` is authored∪binding deps; snapshot keeps the `${{ }}` literal; missing output → tool not called + `BINDING_UNRESOLVED`; resolved args reach the port. **Does not** prove a product port cannot read env on its own | `packages/flows` `bindings.test.ts` · `check.test.ts` · `run/invoke-step.test.ts` |
| **CP-FLOWS-REDACT** | `sensitiveOutput: true` → D1 receipt `output === '[redacted]'` and the raw substring is absent; flag absent → capped raw text at 4096; invoke step return has no `output` key; flipping only `sensitiveOutput` leaves `contentDigest` unchanged. **Does not** prove R2 objects or Worker logs are clean | `packages/flows` `registry.test.ts` · `run/invoke-step.test.ts` |

**CP-DOC-HYGIENE table padding:** the ADR index accepts aligned cell padding while still rejecting mismatched ADR references and statuses.

**CP-KNIP config-pin self-test:** before each pin case, bare discovery must load that same fixture's `knip.json`, `knip.jsonc`, `.knip.json` or `.knip.jsonc` instead of `knip.ts`; a dead shadow fails and skips its pin proof. The pinned run must exit 1 with `src/unused.ts` in the JSON reporter's **Unused files** category (`issues[].files`), not merely in an unused-export row. An in-suite unpinned `knip --include-entry-exports` case under a live shadow must leave that category oracle red while a substring/`rc=1` proxy would pass. Missing `bun` or `python3` produces an explicit tool-naming `FAIL` before any case. These are synthetic config-selection checks, not unused-export proof under the real Kit rules.

### MCP contract probes — non-claims

| CP | Proves | Does **not** prove |
|---|---|---|
| **CP-MCP-REG** | tools/list (or captured runtime registered names) equals catalogue.names; planted extra name fails assert/smoke | tool business correctness; product apps’ registration discipline fleet-wide |
| **CP-MCP-SMOKE** | stdio JSON-RPC list + ping + whoami path works; whoami body matches whoamiResultSchema; no sk_ in results | auth IDOR / org RBAC; cookie session; product tools; hosted HTTP; MCP OAuth |
| **CP-MCP-REFUSAL** | Edge and stdio transport results for explicit refusals, ordinary domain data and unexpected throws | deployed Worker delivery, OAuth authorization and Product tool correctness |
| **CP-MCP-HTTP-OAUTH** | hosted 401 challenge + OAuth connect + ping with Worker token | stdio smoke; cookie session; org RBAC; product tools; spend / grant∩ |
| **CP-MCP-CONSENT-PRESENTATION** | Escaped static presentation, construction snapshot and French consent controls through the public hosted handler | Truth of App disclosure prose; Product authorization or migration; deployment; same-origin script isolation; fleet-wide KV consistency |
| **CP-MCP-GRANT-ADMISSION** | Public hosted-handler tests (`grant-admission.test.ts`) cover omission compatibility, verified OAuth tuples, request/code/refresh refusals, targeted OAuth grant isolation and recovery after predicate failures without consuming the code | Product policy/marker correctness; instantaneous or globally consistent revocation; whole-KV no-write behavior; Product adoption, deployment or same-origin script isolation |
| **CP-MCP-SCHEMA** | public Zod outs + public error codes stable on kit paths | full FE session; API as sole schema owner for all `/api/me` fields |
| **CP-MCP-BUDGET** | oversized input rejected before handler body; execute not called | full DoS resistance under attack; network-layer limits |

**Honesty:** never claim “verified” for presence-only key checks. Stdio whoami `verified: true` only after `/api/me` subject parse OK. Hosted whoami `verified: true` means MCP identity is present (not `/api/me`). stdio smoke ≠ OAuth.

### Env / i18n / license / import-boundary — non-claims

| Gate | Proves | Does **not** prove |
|---|---|---|
| `env:check` | **`apps/example-api`** schema ↔ `apps/example-api/.dev.vars.example` (+ root `VITE_*` placeholders) | Product app env schemas; runtime secret strength; CF dashboard secrets; deploy config; “all monorepo envs are complete” |
| `i18n:check` / messages contract | Non-empty strings, no raw script tags in catalogs | Correct translation meaning, XSS if you render HTML unsafely |
| `license:check` | SPDX allowlist vs installed tree; the gate itself fails on each planted disallowed shape (self-test) | Package safety, correct license metadata, supply-chain integrity; a package with no readable licence (UNKNOWN) is a warning, not a failure; a GPL-only `LICENSE` file without a package.json field is UNKNOWN (the file patterns recognise permissive licences only) |
| `import-boundary` / **CP-IMPORT** | String-literal `from` / `export … from` / side-effect `import` / `require` / `import()` edges that resolve under forbidden zones (R1–R4) after reason-required exemptions; clean tree exit 0; synthetic plant exit ≠ 0 | Runtime/DI purity; non-literal dynamic imports; full tsconfig alias graph; product-owned layer graphs; R5 routes↛repos; that excluding `*.test.ts` still polices test-only edges; `package.json` deps without a source import |
| `debt:check` / **CP-DEBT** | Line comments `biome-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` / `@ts-ignore` under `apps|packages` tagged with `DEBT:<slug>`; untagged fails by default; stale-without-pin reported (expiry warn → exit 0; fail via `DEBT_EXPIRY_MODE`); a failure of a required Git lookup for an unpinned marker exits 1; self-test covers untagged matrix and expiry (stale fail/warn, pin exempt) | That expiry-warn “manages” stale debt; line-level blame age; open GitHub issue existence for `#N` pins; `biome.json` overrides; suppressions in `scripts/kit/`/`tools/`; full factory debt registry |
| `lint` / **CP-BIOME** | explicit `any` and cognitive complexity > 15 fail as errors even without `--error-on-warnings`; self-test checks the actual root config and plants both plus a DEBT-ignored `any` in a snapshot-based global-rule context, refusing a nonempty binary override or missing local Biome. Grandfathered `cog-*` markers are a mitigation, removed when the Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#287 ceiling reaches 0 (except `cog-shadcn`) | that the snapshot proves ambient config, VCS, nested configs, path overrides or full-root lint context; that info-level complexity rules (`noExcessiveLinesPerFunction` and the rest of the group at default info) are a blocking gate; nursery coverage; that a `DEBT:` tag is present (that is **CP-DEBT**); that the ceiling cannot be bypassed by a new marker (that is **CP-DEBT**) |
| `knip` / **CP-KNIP** | no unused file, export, or dependency in the configured graph; shell-spawned entries and `package.json` `exports` are roots; the root `knip` script loads `knip.ts`, not a discovered root config file | runtime use of a symbol only reached by a stringly path Knip does not parse; that an allowlisted dep is free of CVEs; that a product cannot narrow the analysed project with inputs it can still write: a Knip run without `--config` (`bunx knip`, an editor integration) uses bare discovery and loads a root `knip.json`, `knip.jsonc`, `.knip.json` or `.knip.jsonc` first; a `.gitignore` entry drops tracked files, up to a whole app; root or `product-*.yml` workflow files whose Knip plugins add entries, dependency or binary references, or resolver aliases (for example `Taskfile.yml`, `mise.toml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`), and a root `.yarnrc.yml` read as the catalog source; a file a product script writes during `validate:full` after `zero-edit` has run; a gitignored root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; an ignored file under `protected_prefixes`; `skip-worktree` / `assume-unchanged`; personal ignore sources `.git/info/exclude` and `core.excludesFile`. CI is the guardrail (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#426) |

Worker env SSoT: `apps/example-api/src/env.schema.ts`. Bindings `DB` / `BUCKET` stay out of `.dev.vars`.

### YAML gate dependency boundary

`bun run doc:check` and `bun run stack-contract:check` disable Bun auto-install. A checkout without
installed dependencies therefore exits non-zero with one `run bun install` diagnostic when their
`yaml` dependency is absent; it does not fetch that dependency. Their self-tests launch the actual
package scripts from an isolated dependency-free tracked-tree fixture, verify the resolver cannot
find `yaml`, and use an empty Bun cache. IP network syscall tracing is reported when `strace` exists;
its absence does not weaken the portable missing-dependency assertions.

### Gaps known (honest backlog — force tests when code lands)

| Gap | Status |
|---|---|
| Origin/CSRF middleware on mutations | **Shipped** — `originGuard` + tests (cookie mutations require trusted Origin) |
| Seed/demo users disabled outside dev/test | **Shipped** — `ensureDemoUsers` env-gated; production login does not auto-seed |
| Rate-limit 429 wire + Bearer-vs-cookie exclusivity | Covered by tests after 2026-07 review fix pass; still demo in-memory only |
| Server RBAC (`role` is demo/SPA-facing today) | Do not treat SPA `isAdmin` as security; server checks when admin APIs exist |
| Zip-slip / `private_key` → 404 | **Product** (`apps/<product>-*`), when a product unpacks archives or serves key-gated reads |
| Playwright cookie journey in CI | Phase B6 — Chromium smoke; until then local e2e scripts |
| Mutation testing on `packages/auth` | Optional **nightly / manual**, not PR gate until cheap |
| BA session logout / revoke wire | Covered by BA handler + cookie clear; prefer server-side session revoke tests when extending admin APIs |

### Org invites local E2E (B3 S2)

Automated suite: `apps/example-api/src/invitations.test.ts` (≥ 8 cases: create, accept, email bind, ceiling, IDOR, sk_, 409, super deny, BA DENY).

Manual dogfood (after `bun run db:seed` + API + web):

1. Login `team-owner@kit.local` / `demo-password-change-me` → `/app`.
2. Select org **Team Client** → **Members** → invite `solo@kit.local` as `member`.
3. Inspect Worker log line `transport: "log"` for accept URL (`/invite/accept?invitationId=…`).
4. Logout → login `solo@kit.local` → open accept URL → join → membership on `/api/me` orgs.
5. Confirm `team-reader@` cannot open invite create (403).

Email is **log transport** only on Workers (Mailpit/SMTP is Node `@kit/email/server` — optional later).

### Password reset local E2E (B3 S3)

Automated suite: `apps/example-api/src/password-reset.test.ts` (request known/unknown, reset + single-use, rate limit).

BA 1.6 paths: `POST /api/auth/request-password-reset` · `POST /api/auth/reset-password`.

Manual dogfood:

1. Open `/forgot-password` → submit `demo@kit.local` (or seed persona).
2. Worker log: `transport: "log"` subject “Reset your password” with BA URL containing token.
3. Prefer SPA: open `/reset-password?token=<token>` (or follow BA callback with `redirectTo=http://localhost:5173/reset-password`).
4. Set new password (≥ 8 chars) → redirect login → sign in with **new** password; old fails.
5. Reuse token → error.

Mailpit: optional via Node `@kit/email/server` only — **not** the Worker path. Prod CF Email is epic **go-silex/silex-boilerplate#21**.

## What a good test looks like

1. **Names the bug** — failure mode in the title (`… without auth returns UNAUTHORIZED`).
2. **Asserts the public contract** — status, `error.code`, cookie flags, a11y/DOM, not private helpers.
3. **Includes the negative path** for T0 (reject, 401, IDOR, bad sig).
4. **Stable** — no real network flake, no order-dependent FS.
5. **Fast enough** for pre-push — integration via `createApp` + memory env OK; full browser only for few paths.
6. **Owned by the right layer** — package unit vs app composition (see ownership).

### Refuse / rewrite

- Happy-path only on a new protected resource.
- “Button renders” as substitute for auth.
- Deleting negative cases to green a floor.
- Product scenarios inside `packages/*`.
- AI spam: `expect(true)` / status 200 without contract.

### God-file hygiene

Prefer splitting large HTTP suites by concern while still hitting `createApp`:

```text
auth.contract.test.ts · notes.idor.test.ts · cors.test.ts · …
```

Avoid pure “mock every repo” theatre unless a bug proves the need.

## Coverage tooling (reference)

| Artefact | Role |
|---|---|
| `packages/config/vitest-coverage.mts` | shared v8 include/exclude + thresholds |
| `scripts/kit/test-coverage.sh` | monorepo runner behind root `bun run test:coverage`; calls `bunx vitest run --coverage` per package. Membership is discovered (`test:coverage` script); kit tiers live in the script, product tiers in `config/product/coverage-order.txt` (`<high\|medium\|lower> <workspace>`), and any undeclared, stale or duplicate workspace fails — see **CP-COVERAGE-ORDER**. `COVERAGE_ONLY` keeps one resolved workspace. `COVERAGE_CHANGED_BASE` narrows to changed apps only when every changed path is under an ordered `apps/<name>/`; a package path, a root path or an empty diff keeps the full bar, and an unreadable ref or an app outside the bar refuses to skip it. Neither mode executes the Root gate. Turbo is **not** in this path — `turbo.jsonc` declares no `test:coverage` task |
| `<pkg>/package.json` → `test:coverage` | equivalent per-package entry point for a single package; the monorepo runner bypasses it and invokes `vitest` directly |
| `scripts/kit/print-coverage-summary.mjs` | table after run |
| `coverage/<pkg>/index.html` | HTML report (gitignored) |

Support directories at any depth, DOM setup files, the private auth repo SQLite fixture and the Node-only Worker alias are excluded from runtime coverage by the shared configuration. Coverage floors are unchanged; support execution must not inflate the production-code percentage.

**Interpretation:** low `example-web` / `ui` global % is **expected** while T0 and CP-\* hold. Raise ui/web % only by **adding contract/page tests that map to risk**, not by rendering every shadcn export.

## PR expectations

Use [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

| Touched area | Expected |
|---|---|
| Auth / keys / cookies | Update seam tests; targeted proof + review by an agent independent of implementation |
| Durable execution (Workflows, Queues, DO alarm, Cron) | Targeted proof + review by an agent independent of implementation against [ADR-0018](architecture/adr/0018-durable-execution-ownership.md) D1/D2; no gate checks it |
| New protected resource | **CP-IDOR** + **CP-UNAUTH** cases for that resource |
| `packages/*` public API | Package unit + example still composes it |
| UI primitives trap | Contract test in `packages/ui` (or justify) |
| FE api client | **CP-FE-CRED** stays green |
| Product domain | Must not land in packages (banlist) |

**Test plan section** should list commands actually run, e.g.:

```bash
bun run validate:full
# and/or focused:
bun run --filter @kit/example-api test
```

## Phased tooling

| Phase | Add | Gate? |
|---|---|---|
| **Now** | This doc · local `validate:full` (step list = root `package.json`) · existing Vitest + floors | Yes — local + CI guardrail |
| **B6 / kit polish** | Playwright Chromium: login → session; me/notes smoke; keep design-system smoke | Prefer local first; CI job only when stable (watch merge-on-green “all checks” semantics) |
| **Later** | `test:critical` filter alias for CP-\* | Convenience, not replacement for full pre-push |
| **Later** | Mutation on `packages/auth` | Nightly/manual signal only until &lt;5 min and low noise |

---

## Anti-patterns (ban)

| Anti-pattern | Why |
|---|---|
| Push red, “CI will catch it” | Violates local-first; burns Free minutes |
| `LEFTHOOK=0` / `--no-verify` as habit | Removes the real gate |
| Lower T0 floors “because coverage is radar” | Erodes security bar |
| Treat 10% web floor as “UI security covered” | Theater |
| Apply “don’t test UI” to `apiFetch` / gates / 401 | Account/session regressions free |
| Product fixtures in package tests | Axial drift |
| Optional e2e forever without decision | False confidence |
| Checklist ✅ without CP / test names | Social theater |
