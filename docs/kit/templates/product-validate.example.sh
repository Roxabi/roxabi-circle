# Deploy-gate declaration (Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#317): the inherited kit script runs promote-deploy.ts --check for main,

# origin/deploy/* ref). Call it, never re-type it: this file is product-owned and would freeze a copy.
# Early local signal only: this script runs inside Product CI, the workflow under check, so a PR
# that stops Product CI from running never reaches it. Kit `validate:full` runs the same script in
# the required `ci` job; that is the enforcing path.
