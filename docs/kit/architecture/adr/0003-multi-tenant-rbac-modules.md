# ADR-0003 — Multi-tenant organization, platform RBAC, dual-level modules

## Context

Chemin A kit must support multi-actor SaaS on Cloudflare (Workers · Hono · D1 · Better Auth):

1. **Client space** — users only see data for their client organization(s).
2. **Back-office** — staff operate across granted clients.
3. **Platform ops** — super admin configures what exists on the platform.
4. **Modules** — features can be available platform-wide, then enabled per client.
5. **Solo vs team client** — one person *or* many people under the same client; one data model only.

This kit is the **schema SSoT**; product apps converge here.

Session identity is covered by [ADR-0002](./0002-session-hmac-interim-vs-better-auth.md) (`SessionPort`, **Better Auth only**, dual credential cookie \| `sk_`). This ADR covers **tenancy + authorization + modules** on top of identity. Org/RBAC surfaces assume BA session (HMAC retired).

Human + multi-agent consensus (architect, security-auditor, backend-dev):  
operator analysis archive.

## Options considered

### ω1 — Better Auth organization plugin + kit authz/modules (chosen)

- **Pros:** Aligns with BA session path; org/member/invitation APIs; less custom invite/membership code.
- **Cons:** Schema coupled to BA plugin versions; module matrix stays kit-side (dual mental model).

### ω2 — Kit-only organization / member / invitation tables

- **Pros:** Full control of every column and Phase B custom roles.
- **Cons:** Reimplements invites, active-org, edge cases while already on BA for sessions.

### ω3 — Kit tables now, migrate to BA organization later

- **Pros:** Ships org FKs before BA plugin wiring.
- **Cons:** Double migration; long IDOR window; rejected by panel.

## Decision

### D1 — Tenant is always `organization`

- There is **no** separate “solo client without org” model.
- Solo client = create organization + one membership `owner` (UI may hide the org concept).
- Multi-user client org = same tables, N memberships.
- Organization fields (BA plugin + `additionalFields`):

| Field | Values / notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `name`, `slug` | BA standard |
| `kind` | `client` \| `internal` |
| `status` | `active` \| `suspended` \| `archived` |

### D2 — Identity spine vs kit authz plane

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| User, session, account, OAuth providers | **Better Auth core** (+ social/OIDC plugins as needed) |
| Organization, member, invitation tables | **Better Auth `organization` plugin** |
| System org role on membership | **`member.role` = role_key string** |
| Platform role (`super_admin` \| `staff`) | **Kit table `user_platform_roles`** |
| Module catalogue + per-org enablement | **Kit tables** (not BA access-control statements) |
| Phase B custom roles + per-module grants | **Kit tables** (shipped — see D4) |

**Better Auth organization plugin** is still Better Auth — optional module that adds tenant tables/APIs. It is **not** a second auth product.

Org/RBAC features require a **Better Auth session** (ADR-0002 BA-only). Machine clients use org-bound **`sk_`** where allowed; there is no HMAC session path.

### D3 — System org roles (Phase A)

Allowlisted on `member.role`:

```text
owner > admin > member > reader
```

| role_key | Intent |
|---|---|
| `owner` | Full org control (incl. delete org / transfer ownership rules) |
| `admin` | Members + org modules + write business data |
| `member` | Standard write |
| `reader` | Read-only |

System-role seed capability matrices provide defaults; current authorization resolves per-organization role-module grants. Server rejects role strings outside the configured system and custom roles.

### D4 — Phase B custom roles (shipped 2026-07-31; status corrected 2026-09-18)

Without rewriting the tenant spine, Phase B adds fine-grained grants — **live**, and the source of authority `mintGrantForOrg` reads before a flows run is minted:

```text
organization_roles (per org, is_system flag)
organization_role_module_grants (role_id, module_id, access: write | read | disabled)
```

- Custom roles are **per-organization first** (no live shared platform templates with `organization_id NULL`).
- Templates later = copy-on-create blueprints, not live shared grant rows.
- System roles `owner|admin|member|reader` remain `is_system=true` with seed capability matrix as defaults — **except** the `flows` module, where the V0 seed deviates on purpose: `owner|admin` get `write`, `member|reader` get `disabled` (`ensureSystemRoles`, Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#29 review). Any other module follows `systemRoleGrantSeed`.
- Custom role keys map via `member.role` / membership role field per BA + kit convention; **fine grants resolve kit-side** (not BA static AC alone).
- **Empty `@kit/rbac` package forbidden** — helpers live in `@kit/auth` (pure) and/or app services until ≥2 call sites (A8).
- **Shipped**, not planned. Evidence:

| Artefact | Path |
|---|---|
| Tables | [`migrations/0009_organization_roles_grants.sql`](../../../../apps/example-api/migrations/0009_organization_roles_grants.sql) (go-silex/silex-boilerplate#22) |
| Schema | [`tenancy-schema.ts`](../../../../packages/auth/src/tenancy-schema.ts) — `organizationRoles`, `organizationRoleModuleGrants` |
| Role × module resolution | [`services/org-roles.ts`](../../../../apps/example-api/src/services/org-roles.ts) — `resolveModuleAccess`, `listRolesWithGrants`; read-mostly, it lazily seeds missing system roles/grants |
| System-role seed | [`module-grants.ts`](../../../../packages/auth/src/module-grants.ts) — `systemRoleGrantSeed` |
| Routes | [`orgs-roles.schemas.ts`](../../../../apps/example-api/src/routes/orgs-roles.schemas.ts) — `listRoles`, `createRole`, `patchRoleGrant`, `deleteRole` |
| Request guard | [`middleware/org-context.ts`](../../../../apps/example-api/src/middleware/org-context.ts) → `resolveModuleAccess` |
| Authority consumer | [`services/flows-grant.ts`](../../../../apps/example-api/src/services/flows-grant.ts) — `mintGrantForOrg` |
| Tests | [`org-roles-phase-b.test.ts`](../../../../apps/example-api/src/org-roles-phase-b.test.ts) |

Ship order held: after BA-only (ADR-0002 A0) + A4 shells/invites.

### D5 — Platform roles

| platform_role | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `super_admin` | Platform catalogue, global config, optional cross-org support flags |
| `staff` | Back-office shell; **data access only via org memberships** |
| *(absent)* | Pure client (or no platform privileges) |

Storage: kit table (not BA user `additionalFields` client-writable):

```text
user_platform_roles (
  user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- BA user.id
  role TEXT NOT NULL,        -- super_admin | staff
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
)
```

- Org admins **cannot** set `platform_role` or `platform_modules.available`.
- Staff **never** bypasses membership for tenant data.

### D6 — Staff access = membership only

No parallel `org_grants` table. Staff who work client Acme have a normal `member` row on Acme.  
`platform_role=staff` opens BO UI / listing of **their** memberships, not all orgs.

### D7 — Modules: two levels

**Code registry** (app-owned): `MODULE_IDS` + metadata (labels, requiresConfig). Not product domain strings in packages.

**Level 1 — platform (super_admin):**

```text
platform_modules (
  module_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  available INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- exposed on the platform?
  config_json TEXT,            -- global secrets/config (masked on read)
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
)
```

**Level 2 — per organization (org admin / BO with manage_modules):**

```text
organization_modules (
  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  module_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  enabled INTEGER NOT NULL,
  locked INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- column Phase A; API/UX later, server-enforced when exposed
  config_json TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (organization_id, module_id)
)
```

| Actor | Can |
|---|---|
| Super admin | Set `available`, global `config_json` |
| Org admin / BO admin | Set `enabled` (and later `locked`) **only if** `available` |
| End user | Consume **effective** modules per role grants |

**Effective access (normative):**

```text
can(user, org, module, op) =
  org.status = active
  AND membership active (or route-level super_admin flag)
  AND platform_modules.available
  AND organization_modules.enabled
  AND role_grant(role_key, module, op)   -- per-org role-module grants
  AND (op ≠ write OR grant allows write)
```

Migrate existing `kit_modules` → `platform_modules` (`enabled` → `available`); stop dual-write; drop `kit_modules` after cutover.

### D8 — Org context on requests

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| SPA UX | The SPA keeps its selected org client-side and sends it as the path or header below. Better Auth's active organization is unused: its `set-active` route is denied with every other organization route (D10) |
| Authorization | **Explicit org id** preferred (path `/orgs/:orgId/...`); else validated header (`X-Org-Id`) |
| Resolution order | path || header (no BA active-org fallback) |
| Mismatch | **403** (never silent wrong-tenant write; fail-closed) |
| Every data query | `WHERE organization_id = ?` fail-closed |
| **Kennel exemption (M-10)** | Dogfood `demo_items` / `demo_notes` / demo uploads are **subject-owned**. They MUST NOT take an `organization_id` column or `requireOrgContext` — org-gating writes while listing by subject was the D11 hole. Tenant tables (orgs, tasks, flows, comments) stay on D8. The `demo` module id stays in the catalogue/seed; it is **not** items authorization. |
### D9 — Super_admin support semantics

| Operation | Default |
|---|---|
| Platform routes (catalogue, global config, list orgs) | `requirePlatformRole('super_admin')` |
| Cross-org **read** tenant data | Opt-in per guard: `allowSuperAdmin: true` + **audit** (actor, org, action, requestId) |
| Cross-org **write** tenant data | **Default off**; break-glass only via `allowSuperAdminWrite` on named routes + audit |
| Staff | Never cross-org without membership |

Support may diagnose with read; write is rare and explicit.

### D10 — Invitations (kit product APIs — B3 S2)

- **Shipped (2026-07-31):** kit-owned invite APIs write BA `invitation` rows; BA-native org invite/accept paths stay **DENY**.
- **Widened (2026-10-06, Roxabi/roxabi-boilerplate-cf#394):** every Better Auth organization route is denied, not only invite and accept. A product mount answers the kit 404 on `/api/auth/organization` and every path under it, case and repeated slashes ignored, before the throttle or the handler runs, per the [Better Auth mount contract](../../product-consumer-contract.md#better-auth-mount). Those routes skip the kit's role ceiling, org-status check and audit; the kit organization APIs replace them. A prefix also covers routes a Better Auth upgrade adds.
- Threat model closed:
  - role allowlist `admin|member|reader` (never `owner`)
  - inviter ceiling (`owner` → admin|member|reader; `admin` → member|reader)
  - email bind on accept (normalize trim+lower)
  - TTL 7d · single-use (`pending` → `accepted` / `canceled`)
  - no `platform_role` field · session-only mutations (no `sk_`)
  - cross-tenant delete → **404** · rate limits on create/accept
  - create → send email (log) → on send fail **cancel + error**
- Seed still bootstraps demo memberships; product invites are no longer deferred.

### D11 — API keys (machine / MCP)

- Dual credential **session \| Bearer `sk_`** remains (ADR-0002).
- Multi-tenant keys are **org-bound**: store `organization_id` (+ optional scopes); re-check membership + org active on every use.
- **Subject-global multi-org keys are forbidden.**
- **Kennel exemption (M-10):** tenant routes stay org-bound (a key minted for org A cannot call `/api/orgs/{B}/...`). Kennel rows have no `organization_id`; the key authenticates the **subject**, so it sees that subject's personal items/notes/uploads. That is not a multi-org key.
- Mint: **session only** (not from another key without explicit policy).

### D12 — Guards (compose, fail-closed)

```text
requireSession | requireApiKey   -- identity
requirePlatformRole(min?)        -- platform plane
requireOrgContext(orgRef)        -- membership or flagged super_admin
requireOrgRole(minRole?)         -- owner > admin > member > reader
requireModule(moduleId, op?)     -- effective module access
```

Protected by default; public routes explicit. Prefer **404** on cross-tenant resource IDOR; **403** on authenticated “not allowed” management actions (stable codes in `@kit/core` / types).

### D13 — Package placement (ADR-0001)

| Location | Owns |
|---|---|
| `@kit/auth` | SQL compose artifacts for BA org (+ kit RBAC SQL if shared); role constants; pure hierarchy helpers; thin guard factories with injected ports (**no** product `MODULE_IDS`) |
| `apps/example-*` | Drizzle wire-up, routes, seed multi-persona, module registry, integration tests |
| New `@kit/rbac` / `@kit/tenancy` | **No** empty package in Phase A (promote only at two call sites or superseding ADR) |

### D14 — Seed acceptance (kit demo)

| Persona | platform_role | Memberships |
|---|---|---|
| Super admin | super_admin | optional |
| Staff A | staff | org_acme `admin`, org_beta `member` |
| Solo client | — | org_solo `owner` (sole member) |
| Team owner | — | org_team `owner` |
| Team reader | — | org_team `reader` |

Modules: e.g. `feedback` available on platform; enabled on acme; disabled on beta.

IDOR / cross-role tests are a **quality gate** for tenant routes (see consensus matrix / `docs/kit/testing.md` CP-IDOR extensions).

### D15 — Session-bound Impersonation

Impersonation is a separate, default-deny delegation, not the support bypass in D9. A `super_admin` configures independent `read` and `write` permissions for each internal Platform Role. Both the real operator and represented User must be members of the same active Organization, including when the operator is a `super_admin`. Represented Users cannot hold a Platform Role; self-delegation and chains are refused.

The verified Better Auth session remains the operator's session. A server-owned row pins its session id, real actor, represented User, Organization and mode; it issues no target session or credential. There is no additional duration limit or reauthentication step. Better Auth validity and live membership, Platform Role, delegation permission and target Module grants remain authoritative on every request.

The Example App admits explicit Organization-scoped business operations only. Target guards still apply, with no operator privilege union or Organization bypass. Delegated reads do not initialize business rows. Account/security changes, invitations, API keys, MCP/OAuth, durable flow operations and personal subject-owned routes are refused, including effectful GET endpoints.

Clients send the exact public delegation id in `X-Impersonation-Id`, or `none` outside Impersonation. This is a context fence, never a credential: stale or missing context cannot silently execute as another principal, including through Bearer fallback after session loss. `/api/me` is a recovery read and stop uses the real session. Revoked delegation authority leaves a recovery-only identity with `active: false`, no target profile or memberships, and no business access until explicit return.

Start and permission changes commit with their audit event atomically. Each admitted business request first persists an attributed **attempt**, not a claim of a successful committed mutation; failed trace persistence prevents dispatch. Stop conditionally deletes the expected delegation independently of its best-effort audit. Previously admitted work can finish under its captured identity; stopping does not promise rollback.

All tabs sharing the session use one represented User, a persistent actor/target banner and explicit return, with principal-cache invalidation. V1 has no consent request, consent configuration or status, target notification, delegation expiry, or step-up. Storage and repositories are exported by `@kit/auth`; App-owned routing and operation policy compose them. The additive `impersonation` core schema id is applied through the normal consumer schema-sync contract.

## Phasing

| Phase | Scope | Status (2026-09-18) |
|---|---|---|
| **A0** | Session BA-only — **HMAC retired** (ADR-0002 amend) | **Shipped** (epic B2 / go-silex/silex-boilerplate#14) |
| **A1** | BA `organization` plugin + four roles + org `kind`/`status` | **Shipped** (go-silex/silex-boilerplate#11) |
| **A2** | `user_platform_roles` + `platform_modules` + `organization_modules` + migrate `kit_modules` | **Shipped** (go-silex/silex-boilerplate#11) |
| **A3** | Guards + multi-persona seed + IDOR matrix CI; org-bound API keys | **Shipped** (go-silex/silex-boilerplate#11) |
| **A4** | Demo shells `/admin` + `/app` (S1) + kit invites UX (S2) | **S1+S2 shipped** (go-silex/silex-boilerplate#15); S3 reset still open |
| **B** | Custom org roles + per-module write/read/disabled matrix | **Shipped** (go-silex/silex-boilerplate#22, 2026-07-31) — see D4 evidence |

## Consequences

### Positive

- One tenant model for solo and multi-user clients.
- Clear split: BA identity/tenancy spine vs kit platform/modules.
- Dual-level modules match real SaaS (platform catalogue → per-client activation).
- Super_admin and API keys constrained against silent cross-tenant blast radius.
- Phase B custom roles do not require a second tenant system.

### Negative / accepted debt

- Coupling to Better Auth organization schema/migrations.
- Two stores to reason about (`member.role` vs kit module grants / Phase B custom grants).
- Invite UX was seed-only in Phase A — productized in A4 epic.
- Phase B increases authz complexity (IDOR matrix must grow with custom roles).

### Neutral

- Product apps define their own role vocabulary.

## Anti-patterns

- Separate “solo user client” table that bypasses organization.
- `platform_role` settable via invite, signup body, or org-admin APIs.
- Staff listing/acting on all orgs without membership.
- Super_admin write-all default inside `requireOrgContext`.
- Subject-global API keys across multiple orgs.
- Authorizing mutations from BA active-org cookie alone (no path/header re-check).
- Module enablement only in BA static AC statements (no D1 available/enabled).
- Empty `@kit/rbac` package “for later”.
- Copying share-frame `private_acl` / GitHub org recheck as kit multi-tenant spine.
