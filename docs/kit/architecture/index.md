# Architecture and ADR index

This index identifies the architectural authority of every decision record. ADR frontmatter is the source of truth: only `status: accepted` with `normative: true` is binding; proposed or non-normative records remain design input.

## Authority model

| Family | Authority |
|---|---|
| [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) | Auto-loaded constitution: mission, precedence, invariants and hard agent rules |
| Accepted normative ADR | Binding current decision within its stated scope |
| [`platform-direction.md`](./platform-direction.md) | Detailed direction under the constitution; not an implementation backlog |
| Proposed or non-normative ADR | Advisory only; it cannot override the constitution or an accepted normative ADR |

## Decision records

Each ADR's YAML frontmatter is the sole home of its status, normativity and axial marker. Reading a
row: a trailing `(<status>)` names the ADR's status, and a row without one is accepted.
`bun run doc:check` checks this file and the ADR frontmatter. The header of
[`check-adr-frontmatter.ts`](../../../scripts/kit/check-adr-frontmatter.ts) describes the rules,
and CP-DOC-HYGIENE in [`testing.md`](../testing.md) says what the check does and does not claim.

## Reading an ADR

1. Read `status` and `normative` before relying on the decision.
2. Follow `related` references for additional context; the current decision is stated in the ADR itself.
3. Resolve conflicts through the precedence rule in [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md), with ADR-0001 as the axial package/app boundary.
4. Record a new ADR when a stack or cross-cutting architecture decision changes; do not turn working notes into implicit policy.
