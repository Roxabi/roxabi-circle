# Chemin A kit documentation

This index locates the authoritative home for each rule and the operational guidance for using the Kit.

## Authority and navigation

| Home | Authority |
|---|---|
| [This index](./README.md) | Navigation only; it does not create policy |
| [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) | Auto-loaded constitution: mission, precedence, seven invariants and hard rules |
| [Architecture index](./architecture/index.md) | ADR authority model and complete list; each ADR frontmatter owns its status and normativity |
| [Standards](#normative-standards-and-contracts) | Normative when named as a source of truth by the constitution or an accepted ADR |
| [Processes and runbooks](#processes-operations-and-security) | Required operating procedure within their scope; they do not override constitution or ADRs |
| [Playbooks](#onboarding-and-playbooks) | Ordered onboarding guidance built on the contracts |

## Normative standards and contracts

- [Stack A–L](./standards/stack.md) — runtime, frontend, auth, packages, quality and architecture choices.
- [API contract](./api-contract.md) — the published `example-api` OpenAPI document and how it stays a projection of the routes.
- [Testing strategy](./testing.md) — local gate doctrine, risk tiers and CP inventory.
- [Product consumer contract](./product-consumer-contract.md) — zero-edit upstream, fetch-only remotes and product/kit ownership.
- [`@kit/ui` surface](./ui-kit.md) — owned UI package boundary and component contract.
- [Observability](./observability.md) — logging, redaction, traces and operational visibility.
- [Environment model](./environments.md) — local, staging and production isolation contract.
- [Kit schema sync](./kit-schema-sync.md) — product D1 composition rules aligned with ADR-0008.
- [Debt tracking](./debt-tracking.md) — suppression marker policy and its executable gate.
